abstract = {Kinetochores are megadalton-sized protein complexes that mediate chromosome-microtubule interactions in eukaryotes. How kinetochore assembly is triggered specifically on centromeric chromatin is poorly understood. Here we use biochemical reconstitution experiments alongside genetic and structural analysis to delineate the contributions of centromere-associated proteins to kinetochore assembly in yeast. We show that the conserved kinetochore subunits Ame1(CENP-U) and Okp1(CENP-Q) form a DNA-binding complex that associates with the microtubule-binding KMN network via a short Mtw1 recruitment motif in the N terminus of Ame1. Point mutations in the Ame1 motif disrupt kinetochore function by preventing KMN assembly on chromatin. Ame1-Okp1 directly associates with the centromere protein C (CENP-C) homologue Mif2 to form a cooperative binding platform for outer kinetochore assembly. Our results indicate that the key assembly steps, CENP-A recognition and outer kinetochore recruitment, are executed through different yeast constitutive centromere-associated network subunits. This two-step mechanism may protect against inappropriate kinetochore assembly similar to rate-limiting nucleation steps used by cytoskeletal polymers.},

abstract = {Kinetochores, multi-subunit complexes that assemble at the interface with centromeres, bind spindle microtubules to ensure faithful delivery of chromosomes during cell division. The configuration and function of the kinetochore-centromere interface is poorly understood. We report that a protein at this interface, CENP-M, is structurally and evolutionarily related to small GTPases but is incapable of GTP-binding and conformational switching. We show that CENP-M is crucially required for the assembly and stability of a tetramer also comprising CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-K, the HIKM complex, which we extensively characterize through a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. A point mutant affecting the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction hampers kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment and prevents kinetochore recruitment of the CENP-T/W complex, questioning a role of CENP-T/W as founder of an independent axis of kinetochore assembly. Our studies identify a single pathway having CENP-C as founder, and CENP-H/I/K/M and CENP-T/W as CENP-C-dependent followers.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02978.001.},

The subunits form a Y-shaped complex, centered on the Vps34 C2 domain. Vps34 and Vps15 intertwine in one arm, where the Vps15 kinase domain engages the Vps34 activation loop to regulate its activity. Vps30 and Vps38 form the other arm that brackets the Vps15/Vps34 heterodimer, suggesting a path for complex assembly. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to reveal conformational changes accompanying membrane binding and identify a Vps30 loop that is critical for the ability of complex II to phosphorylate giant liposomes on which complex I is inactive.},

The core complex stabilizes open DNA and initiates RNA synthesis, and it is conserved in the Pol I and Pol III transcription systems. Here, we derive the domain architecture of the yeast core pol II initiation complex during transcription initiation. The yeast complex resembles the human initiation complex and reveals that the TFIIF Tfg2 winged helix domain swings over promoter DNA. An 'arm' and a 'charged helix' in TFIIF function in transcription start site selection and initial RNA synthesis, respectively, and apparently extend into the active centre cleft.

Here, we describe a three-tiered hybrid mass spectrometry approach that enables the dissection of macromolecular complexes in order to complement structural studies. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we investigate ribosomes, large ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of a multitude of protein and RNA subunits. We identify sites of sequence processing, protein post-translational modifications, and the assembly and stoichiometry of individual ribosomal proteins in four distinct ribosomal particles of bacterial, plant and human origin. Amongst others, we report extensive cysteine methylation in the zinc finger domain of the human S27 protein, the heptameric stoichiometry of the chloroplastic stalk complex, the heterogeneous composition of human 40S ribosomal subunits and their association to the CrPV, and HCV internal ribosome entry site RNAs.},

Here, we present structural and biochemical data revealing the organization of Hsp104 from Chaetomium thermophilum at 3.7 {\AA}resolution. We show that the coiled-coil domains encircling the disaggregase constitute a 'restraint mask' that sterically controls the mobility and thus the unfolding activity of the ATPase modules. In addition, we identify a mechanical linkage that coordinates the activity of the two ATPase rings and accounts for the high unfolding potential of Hsp104. Based on these findings, we propose a general model for how Hsp104 and related chaperones operate and are kept under control until recruited to appropriate substrates.},

Before chromosome biorientation, anaphase is delayed by a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) that inhibits APC/CCdc20. We used single-particle electron microscopy to obtain three-dimensional models of human APC/C in various functional states: bound to MCC, to Cdc20, or to neither (apo-APC/C). These experiments revealed that MCC associates with the Cdc20 binding site on APC/C, locks the otherwise flexible APC/C in a “closed” state, and prevents binding and ubiquitylation of a wide range of different APC/C substrates. These observations clarify the structural basis for the inhibition of APC/C by spindle checkpoint proteins.},

abstract = {Kinetochores are multisubunit complexes that assemble on centromeres to bind spindle microtubules and promote faithful chromosome segregation during cell division. A 16-subunit complex named the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) creates the centromere-kinetochore interface. CENP-C, a CCAN subunit, is crucial for kinetochore assembly because it links centromeres with the microtubule-binding interface of kinetochores. The role of CENP-C in CCAN organization, on the other hand, had been incompletely understood. In this paper, we combined biochemical reconstitution and cellular investigations to unveil how CENP-C promotes kinetochore targeting of other CCAN subunits. The so-called PEST domain in the N-terminal half of CENP-C interacted directly with the four-subunit CCAN subcomplex CENP-HIKM. We identified crucial determinants of this interaction whose mutation prevented kinetochore localization of CENP-HIKM and of CENP-TW, another CCAN subcomplex. When considered together with previous observations, our data point to CENP-C as a blueprint for kinetochore assembly.},

abstract = {The bacterial type VI secretion system is a multicomponent molecular machine directed against eukaryotic host cells and competing bacteria. An intracellular contractile tubular structure that bears functional homology with bacteriophage tails is pivotal for ejection of pathogenic effectors. Here, we present the 6{\AA}cryoelectron microscopy structure of the contracted Vibrio cholerae tubule consisting of the proteins VipA and VipB. We localized VipA and VipB in the protomer and identified structural homology between the C-terminal segment of VipB and the tail-sheath protein of T4 phages. We propose that homologous segments in VipB and T4 phages mediate tubule contraction. We show that in type VI secretion, contraction leads to exposure of the ClpV recognition motif, which is embedded in the type VI-specific four-helix-bundle N-domain of VipB. Disaggregation of the tubules by the AAA+ protein ClpV and recycling of the VipA/B subunits are thereby limited to the contracted state. {\textcopyright}2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Components of the nuclear periphery coordinate a multitude of activities, including macromolecular transport, cell-cycle progression and chromatin organization. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport, mRNA processing and transcriptional regulation, and NPC components can define regions of high transcriptional activity in some organisms at the nuclear periphery and nucleoplasm. Lineage-specific features underpin several core nuclear functions, and in trypanosomatids, which branched very early from other eukaryotes, unique protein components constitute the lamina, kinetochores and parts of the NPCs. Here we describe an FG-repeat nucleoporin, TbNup53b, that has dual localizations within the nucleoplasm and NPC. In addition to association with nucleoporins, TbNup53b interacts with a knowntrans-splicing component, TSR1, and has a role in controlling expression of surface proteins including the nucleolar periphery-located, procyclin genes. Significantly, while several nucleoporins are implicated in intranuclear transcriptional regulation in metazoa, TbNup53b appears orthologous to components of the yeast/human Nup49/Nup58 complex, for which no transcriptional functions are known. These data suggest that FG-Nups are frequently co-opted to transcriptional functions during evolution, and extends the presence of FG-repeat nucleoporin control of gene expression to trypanosomes, suggesting this is a widespread and ancient eukaryotic feature, as well as underscoring once more flexibility within nucleoporin function.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation depends on sister chromatid cohesion mediated by cohesin. The cohesin subunits Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1 form tripartite rings that are thought to open at distinct sites to allow entry and exit of DNA. However, direct evidence for the existence of open forms of cohesin is lacking. We found that cohesin's proposed DNA exit gate is formed by interactions between Scc1 and the coiled-coil region of Smc3. Mutation of this interface abolished cohesin's ability to stably associate with chromatin and to mediate cohesion. Electron microscopy revealed that weakening of the Smc3-Scc1 interface resulted in opening of cohesin rings, as did proteolytic cleavage of Scc1. These open forms may resemble intermediate states of cohesin normally generated by the release factor Wapl and the protease separase, respectively.},

abstract = {Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a conserved group of molecular chaperones with important roles in cellular proteostasis. Although sHSPs are characterized by their small monomeric weight, they typically assemble into large polydisperse oligomers that vary in both size and shape but are principally composed of dimeric building blocks. These assemblies can comprise different sHSP orthologues, creating additional complexity that may affect chaperone activity. However, the structural and functional properties of such heterooligomers are poorly understood. We became interested in heterooligomer formation between human heat shock protein family B (small) member 1 (HSPB1) and HSPB6, which are both highly expressed in skeletal muscle. When mixed in vitro, these two sHSPs form a polydisperse oligomer array composed solely of heterodimers, suggesting preferential association that is determined at the monomer level. Previously, we have shown that the sHSP N-terminal domains (NTDs), which have a high degree of intrinsic disorder, are essential for the biased formation. Here we employed iterative deletion mapping to elucidate how the NTD of HSPB6 influences its preferential association with HSPB1 and show that this region has multiple roles in this process. First, the highly conserved motif RLFDQxFG is necessary for subunit exchange among oligomers. Second, a site approximately 20 residues downstream of this motif determines the size of the resultant heterooligomers. Third, a region unique to HSPB6 dictates the preferential formation of heterodimers. In conclusion, the disordered NTD of HSPB6 helps regulate the size and stability of heterooligomeric complexes, indicating that terminal sHSP regions define the assembly properties of these proteins.},
