@article{Perkins2010a,
abstract = {Transient interactions, which involve protein interactions that are formed and broken easily, are important in many aspects of cellular function. Here we describe structural and functional properties of transient interactions between globular domains and between globular domains, short peptides, and disordered regions. The importance of posttranslational modifications in transient interactions is also considered. We review techniques used in the detection of the different types of transient protein-protein interactions. We also look at the role of transient interactions within protein-protein interaction networks and consider their contribution to different aspects of these networks.},

@article{Mehta2016,
abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlie most, if not all, cellular functions. The comprehensive mapping of these complex networks of stable and transient associations thus remains a key goal, both for systems biology-based initiatives (where it can be combined with other 'omics' data to gain a better understanding of functional pathways and networks) and for focused biological studies. Despite the significant challenges of such an undertaking, major strides have been made over the past few years. They include improvements in the computation prediction of PPIs and the literature curation of low-throughput studies of specific protein complexes, but also an increase in the deposition of high-quality data from non-biased high-throughput experimental PPI mapping strategies into publicly available databases.},

abstract = {Human Timeless is involved in replication fork sta-bilization, S-phase checkpoint activation and estab-lishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In the cell, Timeless forms a constitutive heterodimeric com-plex with Tipin. Here we present the 1.8 A crystal structure of a large N-terminal segment of human Timeless, spanning amino acids 1–463, and we show that this region of human Timeless harbours a partial binding site for Tipin. Furthermore, we identify mini-mal regions of the two proteins that are required for the formation of a stable Timeless–Tipin complex and provide evidence that the Timeless–Tipin interaction is based on a composite binding interface compris-ing different domains of Timeless.},

@article{Mulholland2015,
abstract = {Any profound comprehension of gene function requires detailed information about the subcellular localization, molecular interactions and spatio-temporal dynamics of gene products. We developed a multifunctional integrase (MIN) tag for rapid and versatile genome engineering that serves not only as a genetic entry site for the Bxb1 integrase but also as a novel epitope tag for standardized detection and precipitation. For the systematic study of epigenetic factors, including Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Tet1, Tet2, Tet3 and Uhrf1, we generated MIN-tagged embryonic stem cell lines and created a toolbox of prefabricated modules that can be integrated via Bxb1-mediated recombination. We used these functional modules to study protein interactions and their spatio-temporal dynamics as well as gene expression and specific mutations during cellular differentiation and in response to external stimuli. Our genome engineering strategy provides a versatile open platform for efficient generation of multiple isogenic cell lines to study gene function under physiological conditions.},
