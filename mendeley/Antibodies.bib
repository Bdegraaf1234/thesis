@article{Strohl2014,
abstract = {Historically, antibody variable domains for therapeutic antibodies have been sourced primarily from the mouse IgG repertoire, and typically either chimerized or humanized. More recently, human antibodies from transgenic mice producing human IgG, phage display libraries, and directly from human B lymphocytes have been used more broadly as sources of antibody variable domains for therapeutic antibodies. Of the total 36 antibodies approved by major maket regulatory agencies, the variable domain sequences of 26 originate from the mouse. Of these, four are marketed as murine antibodies (of which one is a mouse-rat hybrid IgG antibody), six are mouse-human chimeric antibodies, and 16 are humanized. Ten marketed antibodies have originated from human antibody genes, three isolated from phage libraries of human antibody genes and seven from transgenic mice producing human antibodies. Five antibodies currently in clinical trials have been sourced from camelids, as well as two from non-human primates, one from rat, and one from rabbit. Additional sources of antibody variable domains that may soon find their way into the clinic are potential antibodies from sharks and chickens. Finally, the various methods for retrieval of antibodies from humans, mouse and other sources, including various display technologies and amplification directly from B cells, are described.},

abstract = {As medicine progresses into a new era of personalised therapy, the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat a wide range of diseases lies at the heart of this new forefront. Since the licencing of the first monoclonal antibody for clinical use 30 years ago, the monoclonal antibody industry has expanded exponentially and is now valued at billions of dollars. With major advances in genetic sequencing and biomedical research, much research into monoclonal antibodies now focuses on identifying new targets for development and maximising their efficacy for use in clinical practice. However, a balance has to be struck with regards to reducing numbers of side-effects and overall economic cost, which arguably somewhat blighted their early clinical and commercial successes. Nowadays, there are approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies that have been approved for use in clinical practice with many more currently being tested in clinical trials. Some of the current major limitations include: the use of inefficient models for generation, a lack of efficacy and issues of cost-effectiveness. Some of the current research focuses on ways to improve the efficacy of existing monoclonal antibodies through optimising their effects and the addition of beneficial modifications. This review will focus on the history of monoclonal antibody development - how it has increasingly moved away from using laborious animal models to a more effective phage display system, some of the major drawbacks from a clinical and economical point of view and future innovations that are currently being researched to maximise their effectiveness for future clinical use.},

abstract = {The immunopathogenesis of severe dengue is poorly understood, but there is concern that induction of cross-reactive nonneutralizing antibodies by infection or vaccination may increase the likelihood of severe disease during a subsequent infection. We generated a total of 63 new human monoclonal antibodies to compare the B-cell response of subjects who received the National Institutes of Health live attenuated dengue vaccine rDEN1{\$}\Delta{\$}30 to that of subjects following symptomatic primary infection with DENV1. Both infection and vaccination induced serum neutralizing antibodies and DENV1-reactive peripheral blood B cells, but the magnitude of induction was lower in vaccinated individuals. Serotype cross-reactive weakly neutralizing antibodies dominated the response in both vaccinated and naturally infected subjects. Antigen specificities were very similar, with a slightly greater percentage of antibodies targeting E protein domain I/II than domain III. These data shed light on the similarity of human B-cell response to live attenuated DENV vaccine or natural infection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Biological agents have been a treatment option for many chronic immune-mediated diseases as well as oncological conditions. The issue of infusion reactions is of particular importance and at least in some cases related to the immunogenicity of these drugs with the production of antidrug antibodies. Infectious diseases are a well described side-effect of certain biological agents, even if, at least regarding the biological agents used for the treatment of allergic diseases and immune-mediated diseases, the risk has been reduced. Biological agents clearly impact the physiological functions of the immune system also those connected to immunosurveillance against cancers. This review discusses the safety profile to the main biological agents currently in use in allergic and chronic immune-mediated diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: By reducing chronic inflammation in immune-mediated diseases, biological agents decrease mortality, cardiovascular events without increasing significantly the risk of cancer. In addition, specific clinical procedure enables the identification of potentially reactive patients and the prevention of acute severe reactions. Overall, the ratio between therapeutic and side-effects is clearly in favor of the former. SUMMARY: The safety profile of biological agents is, just as much as their efficacy, one of the fundamental criteria justifying their clinical broad use},

abstract = {Antibodies can swiftly provide therapeutics to target disease-related molecules discovered in genomic research. Antibody engineering techniques have been actively developed and these technological innovations have intensified the development of therapeutic antibodies. From the mid-1990's, a series of therapeutic antibodies were launched that are now being used in clinic. The disease areas that therapeutic antibodies can target have subsequently expanded, and antibodies are currently utilized as pharmaceuticals for cancer, inflammatory disease, organ transplantation, cardiovascular disease, infection, respiratory disease, ophthalmologic disease, and so on. This paper briefly describes the modes of action of therapeutic antibodies. Several non-clinical study results of the pathological changes induced by therapeutic antibodies are also presented to aid the future assessment of the toxic potential of an antibody developed as a therapeutic.},

abstract = {Autoantibody profiling has gained increasing interest in the research field of glaucoma promising the detection of highly specific and sensitive marker candidates for future diagnostic purposes. Recent studies demonstrated that immune responses are characterized by the expression of congruent or similar complementarity determining regions (CDR) in different individuals and could be used as molecular targets in biomarker discovery. Main objective of this study was to characterize glaucoma-specific peptides from the variable region of sera-derived immunoglobulins using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based quantitative proteomics. IgG was purified from sera of 13 primary open-angle glau-coma patients (POAG) and 15 controls (CTRL) and subsequently digested into Fab and Fc by papain. Fab was further purified, tryptic digested and measured by LC-MS/MS. Discovery proteomics revealed in total 75 peptides of the variable IgG domain showing significant glaucoma-related level changes (P {\textless} 0.05; log2 fold change ! 0.5): 6 peptides were high abundant in POAG sera, whereas 69 peptides were low abundant in comparison to CTRL group. Via accurate inclusion mass screening strategy 28 IgG V domain peptides were further validated showing significantly decreased expression levels in POAG sera. Amongst others 5 CDR1, 2 CDR2 and 1 CDR3 sequences. In addition, we observed significant shifts in the variable heavy chain family distribution and disturbed j/k ratios in POAG patients in contrast to CTRL. These findings strongly indicate that glaucoma is accompanied by systemic effects on antibody production and B cell maturation possibly offering new prospects for future diagnostic or therapy purposes.},

abstract = {Antibodies targeting the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (EBOV GP) are implicated in protection against lethal disease, but the characteristics of the human antibody response to EBOV GP remain poorly understood. We isolated and characterized 349 GP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor who survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire outbreak. Remarkably, 77{\%} of the mAbs neutralize live EBOV, and several mAbs exhibit unprecedented potency. Structures of selected mAbs in complex with GP reveal a site of vulnerability located in the GP stalk region proximal to the viral membrane. Neutralizing antibodies targeting this site show potent therapeutic efficacy against lethal EBOV challenge in mice. The results provide a framework for the design of new EBOV vaccine candidates and immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.
