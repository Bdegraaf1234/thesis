abstract = {b S Supporting Information W ith the inception of new protein engineering technologies, monoclonal antibodies, once deemed "magic bullets," are again gaining popularity as an effective therapeutic tool against various diseases, including cancer. As a result, monoclonal antibodies in general and immunoglobulins in particular currently constitute an important number of therapeutic drugs (also called biologicals) under development in the biopharmaceutical industry. 1 Immunoglobulins play an essential role in the immune systems and can be found in the blood of vertebrates. Among the different classes of immunoglobulins, secreted immunoglobulins G (IgGs) are the most abundant. 2 A schematic representation of the Y-shaped structure of IgGs is shown in Scheme S1, which is given in the Supporting Information. All IgG antibodies have two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. Each chain consists of constant and variable regions, the latter being responsible for the recognition and binding of antigens. The identification of the intact mass and sequencing of the constant and variable domains of the IgGs is important for the quality control of recombinant antibodies to be used as drugs. 3 Therefore , mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) play an important role in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of IgGs. 4 Specifically, mass spectrometric analysis is used to confirm the stability of IgGs in processing and storage, to identify and quantify their often highly heterogeneous post-translational modification (PTM) profiles, and to provide in-depth information on PTMs location and structure. MS/MS techniques are primarily used in the so-called bottom-up MS approach, in which IgGs are enzymatically cleaved in solution prior to ionization and MS/MS analysis. Similarly, specific PTM analysis may involve an enzymatic digestion that, in turn, may lead to the loss of PTMs (e.g., carbohydrates) prior to MS and MS/MS analysis. 5 Prolonged digestion at relatively high (37 °C) temperature, which is required for complete enzymatic action, can produce the artifacts and, particularly for IgGs, lead to an increased rate of deamidation and oxidation, preventing the correct identification of certain PTMs, such as Asp isomerization. 2 Top-down mass spectrometry refers to mass spectrometric monitoring of the gas-phase fragmentation of biomolecular ions of any size. 6{\`{A}}8 A growing number of protein and RNA characterization experiments performed by top-down mass spectro-metry in both direct infusion and coupled with online protein mixture purification and separation has been reported. 9{\`{A}}18 ABSTRACT: Improving qualitative and quantitative characterization of monoclonal antibodies is essential, because of their increasing popularity as therapeutic drug targets. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-based top-down mass spectrome-try (MS) is the method of choice for in-depth characterization of post-translationally modified large peptides, small-and medium-sized proteins, and noncovalent protein complexes. Here, we describe the performance of ETD-based top-down mass spectrometry for structural analysis of intact 150 kDa monoclonal antibodies, immunoglobulins G (IgGs). Simultaneous mass analysis of intact IgGs as well as a complex mixture of ETD product ions at sufficiently high resolution and mass accuracy in a wide m/z range became possible because of recent advances in state-of-the-art time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. High-resolution ETD TOF MS performed on IgG1-kappa from murine myeloma cells and human anti-Rhesus D IgG1 resulted in extensive sequence coverage of both light and heavy chains of IgGs and revealed information on their variable domains. Results are superior and complementary to those previously generated by collision-induced dissociation. However, numerous disulfide bonds drastically reduce the efficiency of top-down ETD fragmentation within the protected sequence regions, leaving glycosylation uncharacterized. Further increases in the experiment sensitivity and improvement of ion activation before and after ETD reaction are needed to target S{\`{A}}S bond-protected sequence regions and post-translational modifications.},

abstract = {We report a fast and highly efficient diazonium reaction that couples a nitroazobenzene chromophore to tyrosine and histidine residues, thus endowing peptides with high photoabsorption cross sections at 351 nm in the gas phase. Only the tagged peptides undergo ultraviolet photo-dissociation (UVPD) at 351 nm, as demonstrated for several Tyr-and His-containing peptides from protein digests. Additional selectivity is achieved by the integration of the UVPD-MS method with an in silico database search restricted to Tyr-and His-containing peptides. A modified MassMatrix algorithm condenses analysis by filtering the input database file to include Tyr/His-containing peptides only, thus reducing the search space and increasing confidence. In summary, derivatization of specific amino acid residues in conjunction with selective activation of the derivatized peptides provides a streamlined approach to shotgun proteomics. M ass spectrometry-based proteomic strategies have become integral analytical methods for structural biology studies, 1,2 biomarker exploration, 3,4 and advancing the field of drug discovery. 5,6 The conventional bottom-up workflow entails digestion of proteins into peptides prior to LC-MS/MS analysis and database searching or de novo sequencing to link the spectra to their parent proteins. 7,8 This is typically done in a shotgun manner in which only a fraction of the peptides derived from a given protein are analyzed and used for identification. As the complexity of the protein mixture increases, the quality of MS/MS spectra, and the ability to interpret them via de novo methods or assign them using database search methods, suffer from simultaneous fragmentation of co-isolated species that fall within the typical 2 Da precursor selection windows commonly used in LC-MS/ MS methods. 9,10 These two factors (high level of sample complexity and concurrent isolation/activation of near isobaric precursor ions) contribute to false positive peptide identifications. Targeted proteomics methods have thus been developed to increase sensitivity of analysis through the selection of peptides representative of a subset of the proteome of interest. 11 For example, recent methods have been used to strategically reduce the number of peptides analyzed based on protein structure, reactivity of specific amino acid residues, and signature activation methods. 1,7,12 In this context, many studies have reported the development of chemical labeling and sequestra-tion of specific peptides for comparative proteomics and positional proteomic applications. 3,13 For instance, the selective analysis of N-terminal peptides of proteins is one way to reduce sample complexity and still retain a unique signature for each protein. 14−20,3,13 Strategies for N-terminal analysis typically use selective labeling methods (e.g., to cap cross-reactive primary amines on lysine side chains or to modify the targeted N-terminal peptides) and enrichment of the N-terminal peptides using ion exchange chromatography, streptavidin columns, or selective resins. 14−20 Alternatively, several approaches have been developed for selective targeting of the C-terminus, despite its lower reactivity, in comparison to the N-terminus. 21−23 Jaffrey and co-workers utilized carboxypeptidase Y to add biotin affinity tags to the C-termini of proteins, followed by enrichment, tryptic digestion, and isolation of the tagged C-terminal peptides. 23 The selective isolation and MS/ MS sequencing of solely N-terminal or C-terminal peptides provided a general means to identify proteins without the redundant analysis of all other proteolytic peptides. In another approach for streamlining proteomics, Coon and co-workers recently used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to sort, count, and identify lysine-containing peptides, based on observed mass defects of the labeled amino acids. 24 Additional information obtained from subsequent MS/},

abstract = {Recent emergence of new mass spectrometry techniques (e.g. electron transfer dissociation, ETD) and improved availability of additional proteases (e.g. Lys-N) for protein digestion in high-throughput experiments raised the challenge of designing new algorithms for interpreting the resulting new types of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Traditional MS/MS database search algorithms such as SEQUEST and Mascot were originally designed for collision induced dissociation (CID) of tryptic peptides and are largely based on expert knowledge about fragmentation of tryptic peptides (rather than machine learning techniques) to design CID-specific scoring functions. As a result, the performance of these algorithms is suboptimal for new mass spectrom-etry technologies or nontryptic peptides. We recently proposed the generating function approach (MS-GF) for CID spectra of tryptic peptides. In this study, we extend MS-GF to automatically derive scoring parameters from a set of annotated MS/MS spectra of any type (e.g. CID, ETD, etc.), and present a new database search tool MS-GFDB based on MS-GF. We show that MS-GFDB outperforms Mascot for ETD spectra or peptides digested with Lys-N. For example, in the case of ETD spectra, the number of tryptic and Lys-N peptides identified by MS-GFDB increased by a factor of 2.7 and 2.6 as compared with Mascot. Moreover, even following a decade of Mascot developments for analyzing CID spectra of tryptic peptides, MS-GFDB (that is not particularly tailored for CID spectra or tryptic peptides) resulted in 28{\%} increase over Mascot in the number of peptide identifications. Finally, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing multiple spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs) and assigning p values to peptide-spectrum-spectrum matches. Molecular {\&} Cellular Proteomics 9:2840-2852, 2010. Since the introduction of electron capture dissociation (ECD) 1 in 1998 (1), electron-based peptide dissociation technologies have played an important role in analyzing intact proteins and post-translational modifications (2). However, until recently, this research-grade technology was available only to a small number of laboratories because it was commercially unavailable, required experience for operation, and could be implemented only with expensive FT-ICR instruments. The discovery of electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) (3) enabled an ECD-like technology to be implemented in (relatively cheap) ion-trap instruments. Nowadays, many researchers are employing the ETD technology for tandem mass spectra generation (4-9). Although the hardware technologies to generate ETD spectra are maturing rapidly, software technologies to analyze ETD spectra are still in infancy. There are two major approaches to analyzing tandem mass spectra: de novo sequencing and database search. Both approaches find the best-scoring pep-tide either among all possible peptides (de novo sequencing) or among all peptides in a protein database (database search). Although de novo sequencing is emerging as an alternative to database search, database search remains a more accurate (and thus preferred) method of spectral interpretation , so here we focus on the database search approach. Numerous database search engines are currently available, including SEQUEST (10), Mascot (11), OMSSA (12), X!Tandem (13), and InsPecT (14). However, most of them are inadequate for the analysis of ETD spectra because they are optimized for collision induced dissociation (CID) spectra that show different fragmentation propensities than those of ETD spectra. Additionally, the existing tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) tools are biased toward the analysis of tryptic peptides be-From the ‡Department 1 The abbreviations used are: ECD, electron capture dissociation; ETD, electron transfer dissociation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrom-etry; CID, collision induced dissociation; FDR, false discovery rate; PSM, peptide-spectrum match; PS 2 M, peptide-spectrum-spectrum match; SCX, strong cation exchange; PRM, prefix-residue mass; PTM, post-translational modification; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.},

abstract = {The primary structural information of proteins employed as biotherapeutics is essential if one wishes to understand their structure-function relationship, as well as in the rational design of new therapeutics and for quality control. Given both the large size (around 150 kDa) and the structural complexity of intact immunoglobulin G (IgG), which includes a variable number of disulfide bridges, its extensive fragmentation and subsequent sequence determination by means of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) are challenging. Here, we applied electron transfer dissociation (ETD), implemented on a hybrid Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS), to analyze a commercial recombinant IgG in a liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) top-down experiment. The lack of sensitivity typically observed during the top-down MS of large proteins was addressed by averaging time-domain transients recorded in different LC-MS/MS experiments before performing Fourier transform signal processing. The results demonstrate that an improved signal-to-noise ratio, along with the higher resolution and mass accuracy provided by Orbitrap FTMS (relative to previous applications of top-down ETD-based proteomics on IgG), is essential for comprehensive analysis. Specifically, ETD on Orbitrap FTMS produced about 33{\%} sequence coverage of an intact IgG, signifying an almost 2-fold increase in IgG sequence coverage relative to prior ETD-based analysis of intact monoclonal antibodies of a similar subclass. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology to other classes of large proteins and biomolecules.},

abstract = {Protein identification and peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry requires knowledge of how peptides fragment in the gas phase, specifically which bonds are broken and where the charge(s) resides in the products. For many peptides, cleavage at the amide bonds dominate, producing a series of ions that are designated b and y. For other peptides, enhanced cleavage occurs at just one or two amino acid residues. Surface-induced dissociation, along with gas-phase collision-induced dissociation performed under a variety of conditions, has been used to refine the general 'mobile proton' model and to determine how and why enhanced cleavages occur at aspartic acid residues and protonated histidine residues. Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues occurs when the charge is unavailable to the peptide backbone or the acidic side-chain. The acidic H of the side-chain then serves to initiate cleavage at the amide bond immediately C-terminal to Asp (or Glu), producing an anhydride. In contrast, enhanced cleavage occurs at His when the His side-chain is protonated, turning His into a weak acid that can initiate backbone cleavage by transferring a proton to the backbone. This allows the nucleophilic nitrogen of the His side-chain to attack and form a cyclic structure that is different from the 'typical' backbone cleavage structures.},

abstract = {The analysis of peptides and proteins as well as the grander scope of proteomics (large scale study of proteins) has been advanced by the development of a versatile array of ion activation methods that have facilitated characterization of peptides and proteins based on formation of diagnostic fragmentation patterns. Improvement of mass spectrometry instrumentation and sample processing methodologies have allowed intensive analysis of complex cell lysates, thus making it possible to identify thousands of proteins in addition to enabling comprehensive characterization of post translational modifications. The successful elucidation of the primary sequence of many peptides and proteins through tandem mass spectrometry has accelerated the development of other complementary methods that support targeted strategies and quantitative approaches and have catalyzed new applications of mass spectrometry in related fields, such as structural biology. This review will describe the development and applications of ion activation methods for peptides and proteins that have played such a critical role in the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, biotechnology, and structural biology. Moreover, unravelling the fundamental underpinnings of these activation methods have shed light on the factors that influence ion fragmentation upon energization, thus providing predictive insight and motivating new strategies that capitalize on manipulating ion dissociation behavior for specific applications. Given the critical role that tandem mass spectrometry has played in the field of proteomics and structural biology, this review will emphasize the ion activation methods that have been used to analyze peptides and proteins with an emphasis on new applications over the past three years. There are numerous excellent review and tutorial articles that have focused on mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies, proteomic applications, and specific activation methods in recent years, and thus readers are directed to these to provide additional perspectives. In addition, a recent review focused specifically on activation methods in proteomics with an emphasis on characterization of post-translational modifications and tandem mass spectrometry methods for quantitation, so these topics are not covered here. This review opens with some basic tutorial sections to provide background information, followed by more specialized sub-topics that demonstrate some of the more recent high impact applications of activation methods for peptides and proteins.},
