abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a disruptive technology that has found widespread acceptance in the life sciences research community. The high throughput and low cost of sequencing has encouraged researchers to undertake ambitious genomic projects, especially in de novo genome sequencing. Currently, NGS systems generate sequence data as short reads and de novo genome assembly using these short reads is computationally very intensive. Due to lower cost of sequencing and higher throughput, NGS systems now provide the ability to sequence genomes at high depth. However, currently no report is available highlighting the impact of high sequence depth on genome assembly using real data sets and multiple assembly algorithms. Recently, some studies have evaluated the impact of sequence coverage, error rate and average read length on genome assembly using multiple assembly algorithms, however, these evaluations were performed using simulated datasets. One limitation of using simulated datasets is that variables such as error rates, read length and coverage which are known to impact genome assembly are carefully controlled. Hence, this study was undertaken to identify the minimum depth of sequencing required for de novo assembly for different sized genomes using graph based assembly algorithms and real datasets. Illumina reads for E.coli (4.6 MB) S.kudriavzevii (11.18 MB) and C.elegans (100 MB) were assembled using SOAPdenovo, Velvet, ABySS, Meraculous and IDBA-UD. Our analysis shows that 50X is the optimum read depth for assembling these genomes using all assemblers except Meraculous which requires 100X read depth. Moreover, our analysis shows that de novo assembly from 50X read data requires only 6-40 GB RAM depending on the genome size and assembly algorithm used. We believe that this information can be extremely valuable for researchers in designing experiments and multiplexing which will enable optimum utilization of sequencing as well as analysis resources.},

@article{Richterich1998,
abstract = {As DNA sequencing is performed more and more in a mass-production-like manner, efficient quality control measures become increasingly important for process control, but so also does the ability to compare different methods and projects. One of the fundamental quality measures in sequencing projects is the position-specific error probability at all bases in each individual sequence. Accurate prediction of base-specific error rates from "raw" sequence data would allow immediate quality control as well as benchmarking different methods and projects while avoiding the inefficiencies and time delays associated with resequencing and assessments after "finishing" a sequence. The program PHRED provides base-specific quality scores that are logarythmically related to error probabilities. This study assessed the accuracy of PHRED's error-rate prediction by analyzing sequencing projects from six different large-scale sequencing laboratories. All projects used four-color fluorescent sequencing, but the sequencing methods used varied widely between the different projects. The results indicate that the error-rate predictions such as those given by PHRED can be highly accurate for a large variety of different sequencing methods as well as over a wide range of sequence quality.},

@article{Ewing1998,
abstract = {The availability of massive amounts of DNA sequence information has begun to revolutionize the practice of biology. As a result, current large-scale sequencing output, while impressive, is not adequate to keep pace with growing demand and, in particular, is far short of what will be required to obtain the 3-billion-base human genome sequence by the target date of 2005. To reach this goal, improved automation will be essential, and it is particularly important that human involvement in sequence data processing be significantly reduced or eliminated. Progress in this respect will require both improved accuracy of the data processing software and reliable accuracy measures to reduce the need for human involvement in error correction and make human review more efficient. Here, we describe one step toward that goal: a base-calling program for automated sequencer traces, phred, with improved accuracy. phred appears to be the first base-calling program to achieve a lower error rate than the ABI software, averaging 40{\%}-50{\%} fewer errors in the data sets examined independent of position in read, machine running conditions, or sequencing chemistry.},
