abstract = {There are two approaches for de novo protein sequencing: Edman degradation and mass spectrometry (MS). Existing MS-based methods characterize a novel protein by assembling tandem mass spectra of overlapping peptides generated from multiple proteolytic digestions of the protein. Because each tandem mass spectrum covers only a short peptide of the target protein, the key to high coverage protein sequencing is to find spectral pairs from overlapping peptides in order to assemble tandem mass spectra to long ones. However, overlapping regions of peptides may be too short to be confidently identified. High-resolution mass spectrometers have become accessible to many laboratories. These mass spectrometers are capable of analyzing molecules of large mass values, boosting the development of top-down MS. Top-down tandem mass spectra cover whole proteins. However, top-down tandem mass spectra, even combined, rarely provide full ion fragmentation coverage of a protein. We propose an algorithm, TBNovo, for de novo pro...},

abstract = {Full-length de novo sequencing from tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of unknown proteins such as antibodies or proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes remains a challenging open problem. Conventional algorithms designed to individually sequence each MS/MS spectrum are limited by incomplete peptide fragmentation or low signal to noise ratios and tend to result in short de novo sequences at low sequencing accuracy. Our shotgun protein sequencing (SPS) approach was developed to ameliorate these limitations by first finding groups of unidentified spectra from the same peptides (contigs) and then deriving a consensus de novo sequence for each assembled set of spectra (contig sequences). But whereas SPS enables much more accurate reconstruction of de novo sequences longer than can be recovered from individual MS/MS spectra, it still requires error-tolerant matching to homologous proteins to group smaller contig sequences into full-length protein sequences, thus limiting its effectiveness on sequences from poorly annotated proteins. Using low and high resolution CID and high resolution HCD MS/MS spectra, we address this limitation with a Meta-SPS algorithm designed to overlap and further assemble SPS contigs into Meta-SPS de novo contig sequences extending as long as 100 amino acids at over 97{\%} accuracy without requiring any knowledge of homologous protein sequences. We demonstrate Meta-SPS using distinct MS/MS data sets obtained with separate enzymatic digestions and discuss how the remaining de novo sequencing limitations relate to MS/MS acquisition settings.},

abstract = {De novo protein sequencing is one of the key problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, especially for novel proteins such as monoclonal antibodies for which genome information is often limited or not available. However, due to limitations in peptides fragmentation and coverage, as well as ambiguities in spectra interpretation, complete de novo assembly of unknown protein sequences still remains challenging. To address this problem, we propose an integrated system, ALPS, which for the first time can automatically assemble full-length monoclonal antibody sequences. Our system integrates de novo sequencing peptides, their quality scores and error-correction information from databases into a weighted de Bruijn graph to assemble protein sequences. We evaluated ALPS performance on two antibody data sets, each including a heavy chain and a light chain. The results show that ALPS was able to assemble three complete monoclonal antibody sequences of length 216-441 AA, at 100{\%} coverage, and 96.64-100{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Traditional "bottom-up" proteomic approaches use proteolytic digestion, LC-MS/MS, and database searching to elucidate peptide identities and their parent proteins. Protein sequences absent from the database cannot be identified, and even if present in the database, complete sequence coverage is rarely achieved even for the most abundant proteins in the sample. Thus, sequencing of unknown proteins such as antibodies or constituents of metaproteomes remains a challenging problem. To date, there is no available method for full-length protein sequencing, independent of a reference database, in high throughput. Here, we present Database-independent Protein Sequencing, a method for unambiguous, rapid, database-independent, full-length protein sequencing. The method is a novel combination of non-enzymatic, semi-random cleavage of the protein, LC-MS/MS analysis, peptide de novo sequencing, extraction of peptide tags, and their assembly into a consensus sequence using an algorithm named "Peptide Tag Assembler." As proof-of-concept, the method was applied to samples of three known proteins representing three size classes and to a previously un-sequenced, clinically relevant monoclonal antibody. Excluding leucine/isoleucine and glutamic acid/deamidated glutamine ambiguities, end-to-end full-length de novo sequencing was achieved with 99-100{\%} accuracy for all benchmarking proteins and the antibody light chain. Accuracy of the sequenced antibody heavy chain, including the entire variable region, was also 100{\%}, but there was a 23-residue gap in the constant region sequence.},

abstract = {De novo protein sequencing of monoclonal antibodies is required when the cDNA or the original cell line is not available, or when characterization of posttranslational modifications is needed to verify antibody integrity and effectiveness. We demonstrate that Comparative Shotgun Protein Sequencing (CSPS) based on tandem mass spectrometry can reduce the time required to sequence an antibody to 72 hours, a dramatic reduction as compared to the classical technique of Edman degradation. We therefore argue that CSPS has the potential to be a disruptive technology for all protein sequencing applications. Antibodies have been exploited as indispensable reagents for biomedical research and as diagnostic and therapeutic agents 1, 2. The specificity and effector functions of antibodies are highly dependent on the amino acid sequence and the presence (or absence) of specific modifications 3. Although DNA sequencing is routinely used in the initial characterization of monoclonal antibodies, subsequent mutations and modifications are typically recognized by analysis at the protein level. Pre-clinical antibodies may be derived from immunized hosts, commercial sources, gifts from collaborators, or from hybridomas that no longer secrete antibodies and for which the cDNA is not available. It is therefore critical to sequence the antibodies in order to monitor the integrity of the molecule, to troubleshoot performance in pre-clinical assays, to regenerate cDNA by reverse engineering, ultimately to perform quality control 4. In addition, protein-level rearrangements (such as observed on IG4 antibodies) can only be revealed by protein level analysis. Sequencing of (unknown) proteins (and antibodies in particular) remains a challenge. Since antibodies are not directly inscribed in the genome and are constantly created anew, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) database search approaches are not applicable, making Edman degradation the only viable option 5. This is a low-throughput and time-consuming approach since it is characterized by short peptide reads (limited to about 30 aa), requires proteolytic digestion, peptide fractionation, and peptide-by-peptide sequencing. Mass spectrometry can rapidly generate data that can be used either for cDNA primer design (followed by â‰ˆ2 weeks of additional experiments) or combined with Edman degradation to expedite sequencing 6. While this hybrid MS/MS+Edman approach has been successfully applied to the de novo sequencing of antibodies 4 , the Achilles heel of MS/MS sequencing has been the interpretation of spectra (the accuracy of MS/MS sequencing algorithms remains low with only {\~{}}30{\%} of spectra correctly reconstructed 7-9). Bridging this MS/MS sequencing gap not only significantly reduces the total sequencing time but also considerably reduces the sequencing},

Traditional methods that sequence spectra individually are limited by short peptide length, incomplete peptide fragmentation, and ambiguous de novo interpretations. We address these issues by determining consensus sequences for assembled tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra from overlapping peptides (e.g., by using multiple enzymatic digests). We have combined electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation methods to boost interpretation of long, highly charged peptides and take advantage of corroborating b/y/c/z ions in CID/HCD/ETD. Using these strategies, we show that triplet CID/HCD/ETD MS/MS spectra from overlapping peptides yield de novo sequences of average length 70 AA and as long as 200 AA at up to 99{\%} sequencing accuracy.},

abstract = {Database search algorithms are the primary workhorses for the identification of tandem mass spectra. However, these methods are limited to the identification of spectra for which peptides are present in the database, preventing the identification of peptides from mutated or alternatively spliced sequences. A variety of methods has been developed to search a spectrum against a sequence allowing for variations. Some tools determine the sequence of the homologous protein in the related species but do not report the peptide in the target organism. Other tools consider variations, including modifications and mutations , in reconstructing the target sequence. However, these tools will not work if the template (homologous peptide) is missing in the database, and they do not attempt to reconstruct the entire protein target sequence. De novo identification of peptide sequences is another possibility, because it does not require a protein database. However, the lack of database reduces the accuracy. We present a novel proteogenomic approach, GenoMS, that draws on the strengths of database and de novo peptide identification methods. Protein sequence templates (i.e. proteins or genomic sequences that are similar to the target protein) are identified using the database search tool InsPecT. The templates are then used to recruit, align, and de novo sequence regions of the target protein that have diverged from the database or are missing. We used GenoMS to reconstruct the full sequence of an antibody by using spectra acquired from multiple digests using different proteases. Antibodies are a prime example of proteins that confound standard database identification techniques. The mature antibody genes result from large-scale genome rearrangements with flexible fusion boundaries and somatic hypermutation. Using GenoMS we automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of two immunoglobulin chains with accuracy greater than 98{\%} using a diverged protein database. Using the genome as the template, we achieve accuracy exceeding 97{\%}.},

abstract = {Despite significant advances in the identification of known proteins, the analysis of unknown proteins by MS/MS still remains a challenging open problem. Although Klaus Biemann recognized the potential of MS/MS for sequencing of unknown proteins in the 1980s, low throughput Edman degradation followed by cloning still remains the main method to sequence unknown proteins. The automated interpretation of MS/MS spectra has been limited by a focus on individual spectra and has not capitalized on the information contained in spectra of overlapping peptides. Indeed the powerful shotgun DNA se-quencing strategies have not been extended to automated protein sequencing. We demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of automated shotgun protein sequencing of protein mixtures by utilizing MS/MS spectra of overlapping and possibly modified peptides generated via multiple proteases of different specificities. We validate this approach by generating highly accurate de novo reconstructions of multiple regions of various proteins in western diamondback rattlesnake venom. We further argue that shotgun protein sequencing has the potential to overcome the limitations of current protein sequencing approaches and thus catalyze the otherwise impractical applications of proteomics methodologies in studies of unknown proteins. Molecular {\&} Cellular Pro-teomics 6:1123-1134, 2007. Current approaches to proteomics focus on the reliable identification of proteins under the assumption that all proteins of interest are known and present in a database. However , the limited availability of sequenced genomes and multiple mechanisms of protein variation often refute this assumption. Well known mechanisms of protein diversity include variable recombination and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (1). The vital importance of some of these novel proteins is directly reflected in the success of monoclonal antibody drugs such as Rituxan TM , Herceptin TM , and Avastin TM (2, 3), all derived from proteins that are not directly inscribed in any genome. Similarly multiple commercial drugs have been developed from proteins obtained from species whose genomes are not known. In particular, pep-tides and proteins isolated from venom have provided essential clues for drug design (4, 5); examples include drugs for controlling blood coagulation (6-8) and drugs for breast (9, 10) and ovarian (11) cancer treatment. Even so, the genomes of the venomous snakes, scorpions, and snails are unlikely to become available anytime soon. Despite this vital importance of novel proteins, the mainstream method for protein sequencing is still initiated by restrictive and low throughput Edman degradation (12, 13), a task made difficult by protein purification procedures, post-translational modifications, and blocked protein N termini. These problems gain additional relevance when one considers the unusually high level of variability and post-translational modifications in venom proteins (14, 15). Moreover the common labor-intensive approach of DNA cloning and sequenc-ing from Edman chemistry-derived primers requires the additional availability of expensive instrumentation and expertise. The primary function of venom is to immobilize prey, and prey animals vary in their susceptibility to venom. As a result, venom composition within snake species shows considerable geographical variation, an important consideration because snake bites (even by snakes of the same species) may require different treatments. Moreover the amount and number of different proteins and isoforms varies with gender, diet, etc. (16-18). These difficulties have been widely acknowledged (19, 20) and have motivated several attempts at de novo sequencing of MS/MS spectra from venom proteins (21, 22). However, all such attempts were made using traditional approaches that consider each MS/MS spectrum in isolation and thus face difficulties in the reliable interpretation of individual spectra (23-25). Conceptually sequencing a protein from a set of MS/MS spectra can be described by a simple analogy. Imagine a jewelry box with many identical copies of a specific model of bead necklaces. Although all the beads are identical, this model is characterized by having irregular distances between consecutive beads; the set of interbead distances is initially chosen by the designer, and all necklaces are then made using exactly the same specification. Now assume that one day you open your jewelry box and realize that someone has vandalized all the necklaces by cutting them to fragments at randomly chosen bead positions. Can you recover the original design of this model of necklaces as specified by the set of consecutive interbead distances? In this allegory interbead distances correspond to amino acid masses, and beads cor-From the â€¡Department},
