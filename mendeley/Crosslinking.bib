abstract = {Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is essential for gene silencing, establishing transcriptional repression of specific genes by tri-methylating Lysine 27 of histone H3, a process mediated by cofactors such as AEBP2. In spite of its biological importance, little is known about PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions. The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2 that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the methyltransferase site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the chromatin-based regulation of PRC2 activity.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00005.001.},

abstract = {In a previous report (Young et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000, 97, 5802-5806), we provided a proof-of-principle for fold recognition of proteins using a homobifunctional amine-specific chemical crosslinking reagent in combination with mass spectrometry analysis and homology modeling. In this current work, we propose a systematic nomenclature to describe the types of peptides that are generated after proteolysis of crosslinked proteins, their fragmentation by tandem mass spectrometry, and an automated algorithm for MS/MS spectral assignment called "MS2Assign." Several examples are provided from crosslinked peptides and proteins including HIV-integrase, cytochrome c, ribonuclease A, myoglobin, cytidine 5-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, and the peptide thymopentin. Tandem mass spectra were obtained from various crosslinked peptides using post source decay MALDI-TOF and collision induced dissociation on a quadrupole-TOF instrument, along with their automated interpretation using MS2Assign. A variety of possible outcomes are described and categorized according to the number of modified lysines and/or peptide chains involved, as well as the presence of singly modified (dead-end) lysine residues. In addition, the proteolysis and chromatographic conditions necessary for optimized crosslinked peptide recovery are presented. {\textcopyright}2003 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

abstract = {Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) kill bacteria very efficiently by either lytic mechanisms or inhibition of specific bacterial targets. Proline-rich AMPs (PrAMPs), for example, produced in insects and mammals rely on the second mechanism. They bind to the 70 kDa bacterial heat shock protein DnaK and the 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL and interfere with protein folding, but this does not explain their strong bactericidal effects. Thus, we looked for further binding partners of apidaecin 1b, originally identified in honey bees, and two rationally optimized analogues (Api88 and Api137). Because affinity chromatography using Api88 as an immobilized ligand enriched only a few proteins at low levels besides DnaK, we synthesized Api88 analogues substituting Tyr7 with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa), which can cross-link the peptide to binding partners after UV irradiation. Escherichia coli was incubated with biotinylated Api88 Tyr7Bpa or the corresponding all-d-peptide, irradiated, and lysed. The protein extract was enriched by streptavidin, separated by SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by nanoRP-UPLC-ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS. Among the 41 proteins identified, 34 were detected only in the l-Api88 Tyr7Bpa sample, including five 70S ribosomal proteins, DNA-directed RNA polymerase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that PrAMPs might interfere with protein translation and energy metabolism.},

abstract = {Closely related to studying the function of a protein is the analysis of its three-dimensional structure and the identification of interaction sites with its binding partners. An alternative approach to the high-resolution methods for three-dimensional protein structure analysis, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, consists of covalently connecting two functional groups of the protein(s) under investigation. The location of the created cross-links imposes a distance constraint on the location of the respective side chains and allows one to draw conclusions on the three-dimensional structure of the protein or a protein complex. Recently, chemical cross-linking of proteins has been combined with a mass spectrometric analysis of the created cross-linked products. This review article describes the most popular cross-linking reagents for protein structure analysis and gives an overview of the different available strategies that employ chemical cross-linking and different mass spectrometric techniques. The challenges for mass spectrometry caused by the enormous complexity of the cross-linking reaction mixtures are emphasized. The various approaches described in the literature to facilitate the mass spectrometric detection of cross-linked products as well as computer software for data analyses are reviewed. {\#}},

abstract = {Chemoresistance is a common mode of therapy failure for many cancers. Tumours develop resistance to chemotherapeutics through a variety of mechanisms, with proteins serving pivotal roles. Changes in protein conformations and interactions affect the cellular response to environmental conditions contributing to the development of new phenotypes. The ability to understand how protein interaction networks adapt to yield new function or alter phenotype is limited by the inability to determine structural and protein interaction changes on a proteomic scale. Here, chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry were employed to quantify changes in protein structures and interactions in multidrug-resistant human carcinoma cells. Quantitative analysis of the largest crosslinking-derived, protein interaction network comprising 1,391 crosslinked peptides allows for 'edgotype' analysis in a cell model of chemoresistance. We detect consistent changes to protein interactions and structures, including those involving cytokeratins, topoisomerase-2-alpha, and post-translationally modified histones, which correlate with a chemoresistant phenotype.},

We used the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique interprotein cross-linked peptides with {\textless}1{\%} false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide database searching.

Here we elucidate the structural role of these chaperones in late steps of core particle biogenesis using biochemical, electron microscopy, cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses. In 15S precursor complexes, Ump1 is largely unstructured, lining the inner cavity of the complex along the interface between alpha and beta subunits. The alpha and beta subunits form loosely packed rings with a wider alpha ring opening than in the 20S core particle, allowing for the Pba1-Pba2 heterodimer to be partially embedded in the central alpha ring cavity. During biogenesis, the heterodimer is expelled from the alpha ring by a restructuring event that organizes the beta ring and leads to tightening of the alpha ring opening. In this way, the Pba1-Pba2 chaperone is recycled for a new round of proteasome assembly.},

abstract = {Knowledge of spatial proximity of amino acid residues obtained by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometric analysis provides information about protein folding, protein-protein interactions and topology of macromolecular assemblies. We show that the use of bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl glutarate as a cross-linker provides a solution for two major analytical problems of cross-link mapping by peptide fragment fingerprinting (PFF) from complex sequence databases, i.e., low abundance of protease-generated target peptides and lack of knowledge of the masses of linked peptides. Tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reduces the azido group in cross-linked peptides to an amine group in competition with cleavage of an amide bond formed in the cross-link reaction. TCEP-induced reaction products were separated by diagonal strong cation exchange (SCX) from unmodified peptides. The relation between the sum of the masses of the cleavage products and the mass of the parent cross-linked peptide enables determination of the masses of candidate linked peptides. By reversed phase LC-MS/MS analysis of secondary SCX fractions, we identified several intraprotein and interprotein cross-links in a HeLa cell nuclear extract, aided by software tools supporting PFF from the entire human sequence database. The data provide new information about interacting protein domains, among others from assemblies involved in splicing. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated the conformational flexibility of HOP2/MND1, important for understanding mechanistic details of the heterodimer, by chemical crosslinking in combination with mass spectrometry (XL-MS). The final XL-MS workflow encompassed the use of complementary crosslinkers, quenching, digestion, size exclusion enrichment and HCD based LC-MS/MS detection prior to data evaluation. We applied two different homobifunctional amine-reactive crosslinkers (DSS, BS(2)G) and one zero-length heterobifunctional crosslinker (EDC). Crosslinked peptides of four biological replicates were analyzed prior to 3D structure prediction by protein threading and protein-protein docking for crosslink guided molecular modeling. Miniaturization of the size exclusion enrichment step reduced the required starting material, led to a high amount of crosslinked peptides and allowed the analysis of replicates. The major interaction site of HOP2/MND1 was identified in the central coiled coil domains and an open co-linear parallel arrangement of HOP2 and MND1 within the complex was predicted. Moreover, flexibility of the C-terminal capping helices of both complex partners was observed suggesting the coexistence of a closed complex conformation in solution.},

This increases the expression of Matrilin2 (MATN2), an EGF-like domain-containing protein that traps EGFR at the cell surface to facilitate its activation by EGF. We describe a pharmacological inhibitor of LOX, CCT365623, which disrupts EGFR cell surface retention and delays the growth of primary and metastatic tumour cells in vivo.

abstract = {Protein-RNA cross-linking by UV irradiation at 254 nm wavelength has been established as an unbiased method to identify proteins in direct contact with RNA, and has been successfully applied to investigate the spatial arrangement of protein and RNA in large macromolecular assemblies, e.g. ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). The mass spectrometric analysis of such peptide-RNA cross-links provides high resolution structural data to the point of mapping protein-RNA interactions to specific peptides or even amino acids. However, the approach suffers from the low yield of cross-linking products, which can be addressed by improving enrichment and analysis methods. In the present paper, we introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) as a potent protein-RNA cross-linker. In order to evaluate the efficiency and specificity of DTT, we used two systems, a small synthetic peptide from smB protein incubated with U1 snRNA oligonucleotide and native ribonucleoprotein-complexes (RNPs) from S. cerevisiae. Our results unambiguously show that DTT covalently participates in cysteine-uracil crosslinks which is observable as a mass increment of 151.9966 Da, (C4H8S2O2) upon mass spectrometric analysis. DTT presents advantages for cross-linking of cysteine containing regions of proteins. This is evidenced by comparison to experiments where (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (TCEP) is used as reducing agent, and significantly less cross-links encompassing cysteine residues are found. We further propose insertion of DTT between the cysteine and uracil reactive sites as the most probable structure of the cross-linking products.},

Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical {\$}\alpha{\$}-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases {\$}\alpha{\$}-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease.},

Hydrogel products from Q-Med have nearly same t-MOD about 0.8{\%} and c-MOD about 0.1{\%}, the ratio of c-MOD to p-MOD is about 13{\%}.

@article{Peterson2004,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Alternatives to X-ray crystallographic techniques are needed to probe the structure of the hetero-oligomeric lens protein alpha-crystallin. We utilized mass spectrometry for 3 dimensional analysis (MS3D) to study the quaternary structural characteristics of this important lens protein and molecular chaperone. METHODS: We have employed two types of chemical cross-linkers to probe key protein-protein and protein-solvent interactions of alpha-crystallin using MS3D. Native alpha-crystallin was exposed to 3,3'-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] (DTSSP) and the common fixative, formaldehyde. The reaction products were denatured and enriched in cross-linked and modified species using size exclusion chromatography. Tryptic digests of these fractions were purified using reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by both electrospray and matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Comprehensive spectra for each C18 fraction were screened for ions with mass unique to each chemical treatment and candidate sequences matching the experimental data were assigned using MS3D "Links" and "ASAP" software. Selected ions were sequenced by collision induced dissociation. RESULTS: Peptides including residues 164-175 of alphaB-crystallin and residues 1-99 of alphaA-crystallin were modified by formaldehyde and partially hydrolyzed DTSSP. Peptides containing modified lysines 11, 78, and 99 of alphaA-crystallin were sequenced and the modified amino acids identified. In addition, ions corresponding to intramolecular and/or intermolecular cross-links were assigned a sequence based on two criteria. First, the mass values observed were unique to a single cross-linking experiment and were not present in a control where no cross-linker was utilized. Second, two unique ions detected from different cross-linking experiments were correlated in that the structures assigned to the masses were equivalent apart from the structure of the cross-linker. One such correlation was found involving lysine121, within the "highly conserved alpha-crystallin domain" of alphaB-crystallin, cross-linked to either lysine11 or lysine99 of alphaA-crystallin. Another two independent correlations involving lysine72 of alphaB-crystallin were found that indicate cross-linking of two subunits of alphaB-crystallin through this same residue. CONCLUSIONS: Sequences of peptides modified by partially hydrolyzed DTSSP and formaldehyde provide experimental evidence for models of alpha-crystallin quaternary structure that suggest a similar tertiary fold for both alphaA-crystallin and alphaB-crystallin. Analogous to multiple phosphorylations along the N-terminus of alphaB-crystallin, our data indicate that the same region of alphaA-crystallin, up to and including lysine99 is also relatively accessible to modification despite its hydrophobicity. Mass correlation between experiments using different reagents suggests that cross-linking occurred between N-termini of adjacent subunits of alphaB-crystallin in the native complex in support of the amphiphilic, toroidal, or "open micelle" models. In addition, multiple cross-links involving lysine121 of the so called "dimer interface" region within the "highly conserved alpha-crystallin domain" indicate that this region is a site of inter-subunit contacts in the native context.},

Yet, one of the major drawbacks of this strategy remains the lack of software that is able to handle the large MS datasets that are created after chemical crosslinking and enzymatic digestion of the crosslinking reaction mixtures. Here, we describe a software, termed StavroX, which has been specifically designed for analyzing highly complex crosslinking datasets. The StavroX software was evaluated for three diverse biological systems: (1) the complex between calmodulin and a peptide derived from Munc13, (2) an N-terminal {\ss}-laminin fragment, and (3) the complex between guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 and a peptide derived from retinal guanylyl cyclase. We show that the StavroX software is advantageous for analyzing crosslinked products due to its easy-to-use graphical user interface and the highly automated analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data resulting in short times for analysis. StavroX is expected to give a further push to the chemical crosslinking approach as a routine technique for protein interaction studies.},

Cross-linked sites showed excellent agreement with empirical protein structures and delivered complementary constraints for in silico protein docking. These data established direct physical evidence of the assembly of the complex I-III respirasome and enabled prediction of in situ interfacial regions of the complexes.

This includes insights into multiple conformational states of sarcomere proteins, as well as interactions among OXPHOS complexes indicative of supercomplex assembly. The extension of crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis into the realm of tissues opens the door to increasing our understanding of protein structures and interactions within the context of the greater biological system. Chemical crosslinking with mass spectrometry enabled structural systems biology measurements on proteins within heart tissue. Identified crosslinks provide structural information on key protein systems of the heart including the sarcomere and OXPHOS complexes. Each identified crosslinked peptide pair provides a useful molecular probe that can be used to quantify changes in protein conformations or protein-protein interactions in tissues.},

abstract = {Knowledge of elaborate structures of protein complexes is fundamental for understanding their functions and regulations. Although cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) has been presented as a feasible strategy for structural elucidation of large multisubunit protein complexes, this method has proven challenging because of technical difficulties in unambiguous identification of cross-linked peptides and determination of cross-linked sites by MS analysis. In this work, we developed a novel cross-linking strategy using a newly designed MS-cleavable cross-linker, disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO). DSSO contains two symmetric collision-induced dissociation (CID)-cleavable sites that allow effective identification of DSSO-cross-linked peptides based on their distinct fragmentation patterns unique to cross-linking types (i.e. interlink, intralink, and dead end). The CID-induced separation of interlinked peptides in MS/MS permits MS3 analysis of single peptide chain fragment ions with defined modifications (due to DSSO remnants) for easy interpretation and unambiguous identification using existing database searching tools. Integration of data analyses from three generated data sets (MS, MS/MS, and MS3) allows high confidence identification of DSSO cross-linked peptides. The efficacy of the newly developed DSSO-based cross-linking strategy was demonstrated using model peptides and proteins. In addition, this method was successfully used for structural characterization of the yeast 20 S proteasome complex. In total, 13 non-redundant interlinked peptides of the 20 S proteasome were identified, representing the first application of an MS-cleavable cross-linker for the characterization of a multisubunit protein complex. Given its effectiveness and simplicity, this cross-linking strategy can find a broad range of applications in elucidating the structural topology of proteins and protein complexes.},

The compounds were used under identical conditions and crosslinking efficiency, influence of water, irradiation requirements, and by-products were investigated. Using the pentapeptide thymopentin (TP5) as a model system, we synthesized four analogues by solid-phase peptide synthesis and partially N-terminal modification to obtain [p-(3-trifluoromethyl)diazirinophenylalanine5]TP5, [p-benzoylphenylalanine5]TP5, 4-azidobenzoyl-TP5 and 2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-TP5. The peptides were characterized by HPLC and ion-spray mass spectroscopy. Irradiation of the peptides with two different ultraviolet sources was carried out in water, n-propanol and water/n-propanol to imitate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptide/protein-interactions as well as the influence of the aqueous environment. Analysis of the products with HPLC, ion-spray MS, HPLC-MS and HPLC-CID-MS revealed that (Tmd)Phe is a highly potent carbene-precursor, which can be transformed easily into uniform crosslinking products by smooth photolysis. However, the electrophilic nature of the intermediate causes a high tendency to react with water molecules. The 4-azidobenzoyl group showed comparable crosslinking efficiency, but the probability to create non-uniform irradiation products (e.g. through rearrangement) is higher, whereas the reaction with water is less dominant. In contrast, Bpa was found to have an extremely low affinity to react with water, whereas prolonged UV irradiation is needed to get complete rearrangement into a variety of products. As the absorption band of alpha-diazocarbonyls at around 350 nm possesses a low extinction coefficient, 2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-TP5 could not be activated at all with the optimized irradiation conditions that we have chosen for our comparative studies.},

However, methods for error assessment are under current development. We note that false-discovery rates can be estimated at different points during data analysis, and are most relevant for residue or protein pairs. Missing this point led in our example analysis to an actual 8.4{\%} error when 5{\%} error was targeted. In addition, prefiltering of peptide-spectrum matches and of identified peptide pairs substantially improved results. In our example, this prefiltering increased the number of residue pairs (5{\%} FDR) by 33{\%} (n = 108 to n = 144). This number improvement did not come at the expense of reduced accuracy as the added data agreed with an available crystal structure. We provide an open-source tool, xiFDR (https://github.com/rappsilberlab/xiFDR), that implements our observations for routine application. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004749. C ross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) is emerging as a valuable tool to investigate protein structures, protein complexes, and protein−protein interactions. 1−4 As any method relying on measurement as well as interpretation, CLMS has some level of error.

We have determined that the proteasome network is composed of at least 471 proteins, significantly more than the total number of proteins identified by previous reports using proteasome subunits as baits. Validation of the selected proteasome-interacting proteins by reverse copurification and immunoblotting experiments with and without cross-linking, further demonstrates the power of the QTAX strategy for capturing protein interactions of all natures. In addition, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the identified interactions have been confirmed by existing data using protein network analysis. Moreover, evidence obtained through network analysis links the proteasome to protein complexes associated with diverse cellular functions. This work presents the most complete analysis of the proteasome interaction network to date, providing an inclusive set of physical interaction data consistent with physiological roles for the proteasome that have been suggested primarily through genetic analyses.

abstract = {The resolution and the fidelity of a protein structural model, constructed using crosslinking data, is dependent on the crosslinking distance constraints. Most of the popular amine-reactive NHS-ester crosslinkers are limited in their capacity to provide short distance constraints because of the rarity of lysine residues occurring in close proximity in the protein structure. To solve this problem, hetero bifunctional crosslinkers containing both a non-specific photo-reactive functional group and an NHS-ester group can be used to enable non-specific crosslinking within the proximity of these lysine residues. Here we develop three such isotopically-coded hetero-bifunctional photo-reactive crosslinkers, bearing azido, diazirine or benzophenone photo-reactive groups (azido-benzoic-acid-succinimide (ABAS)-12C6/13C6, succinimidyl-diazirine (SDA)-12C5/13C5, and carboxy-benzophenone-succinimide (CBS)-12C6/13C6, respectively). These crosslinkers were validated using several model proteins/peptides and were then applied to study the structure of the native alpha-synuclein protein. In that case the ABAS crosslinker proved to be the most suitable, with 10 crosslinks being found in the native alpha-synuclein structure. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Structural proteomics can be used for studying protein structures which may be difficult to examine by traditional structural biology methods such as NMR or X-ray crystallography. Crosslinking in particular is used to provide distance constraints for molecular modelling of individual proteins and protein complexes. The shortest distance constraints are most valuable for the modelling process. To be able to provide such short distance constraints, non-specific photo-reactive chemistry can be used for crosslinking reactions. However, detection of such non-specific crosslinks is difficult because the signal from any particular crosslink is low due to the broad reactivity of the crosslinking reagents. To overcome this problem, we have employed isotopic labelling of these crosslinkers. In this paper, we have demonstrated their effectiveness for studying the native alpha-synuclein protein structure. The non-specific reactivity, in combination with isotopic coding of these crosslinkers, allowed for the formation and detection of short-range crosslinks, targeting a variety of amino acids. These reagents may prove useful for future applications to a variety of protein structural problems.},

Although essentially a low-resolution method, it avoids the main drawbacks of established structural techniques. Particularly, it is largely insensitive to the inherent flexibility of the studied complexes and is applied under native conditions. It is also applicable to nearly every structural system. Therefore, cross-linking and mass spectrometry is the method of choice for elucidating the general architecture of protein complexes. Advances in instrumentation, techniques, and software now allow every lab that is working with proteins to apply the approach without much difficulty. The most specialized step in the workflow, the mass spectrometry measurement, can be done in most facilities that are performing standard proteomics. We detail here a step-by-step protocol of how to successfully apply the approach in collaboration with the mass spectrometry facility in your institution.},

abstract = {The study of proteins and protein complexes using chemical cross-linking followed by the MS identification of the cross-linked peptides has found increasingly widespread use in recent years. Thus far, such analyses have used almost exclusively homobifunctional, amine-reactive cross-linking reagents. Here we report the development and application of an orthogonal cross-linking chemistry specific for carboxyl groups. Chemical cross-linking of acidic residues is achieved using homobifunctional dihydrazides as cross-linking reagents and a coupling chemistry at neutral pH that is compatible with the structural integrity of most protein complexes. In addition to cross-links formed through insertion of the dihydrazides with different spacer lengths, zero-length cross-link products are also obtained, thereby providing additional structural information. We demonstrate the application of the reaction and the MS identification of the resulting cross-linked peptides for the chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the 26S proteasome. The results indicate that the targeting of acidic residues for cross-linking provides distance restraints that are complementary and orthogonal to those obtained from lysine cross-linking, thereby expanding the yield of structural information that can be obtained from cross-linking studies and used in hybrid modeling approaches.},

The measurement of structures and topologies of proteins and protein complexes as they exist in cells is particularly challenging, yet critically important to improve understanding of biological function because proteins exert their intended function only through the structures and interactions they exhibit in vivo. In the present study, protein interactions in E. coli cells were identified in our unbiased cross-linking approach, yielding the first in vivo topological data on many interactions and the largest set of identified in vivo cross-linked peptides produced to date. These data show excellent agreement with protein and complex crystal structures where available. Furthermore, our unbiased data provide novel in vivo topological information that can impact understanding of biological function, even for cases where high resolution structures are not yet available},

abstract = {Oxidative stress has been implicated in multiple human neurological and other disorders. Proteasomes are multi-subunit proteases critical for the removal of oxidatively damaged proteins. To understand stress-associated human pathologies, it is important to uncover the molecular events underlying the regulation of proteasomes upon oxidative stress. To this end, we investigated H2O2 stress-induced molecular changes of the human 26S proteasome and determined that stress-induced 26S proteasome disassembly is conserved from yeast to human. Moreover, we developed and employed a new proteomic approach, XAP (in vivo crosslinking (x)-assisted affinity purification) coupled with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative MS, to capture and quantify several weakly bound proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs) and examine their roles in stress-mediated proteasomal remodeling. Our results indicated that the adapter protein Ecm29 is the main PIP responsible for the stress-triggered remodeling of the 26S proteasome in human cells. Importantly, using a newly developed disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO)-based crosslinking MS platform, we mapped the interactions of Ecm29 within itself and with proteasome subunits and thereby determined the architecture of the Ecm29-proteasome complex with integrative structure modeling. These results enabled us to propose a structural model in which Ecm29 intrudes on the interaction between the 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle in the 26S proteasome, thereby disrupting the proteasome structure in response to oxidative stress.},

abstract = {The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay has recently been exploited as a powerful and versatile technique for probing protein-DNA interactions within the chromatin environment. In this method, intact cells are fixed with a reversible DNA-protein cross-linking agent (formaldehyde), and associated DNA is enriched by immunoprecipitating a target DNA binding protein. The bound DNA in the immune complexes is then used to identify that specific DNA binding protein's endogenous genomic targets. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a highly inducible transcription factor that controls genetic networks important for pathogen- or cytokine-induced inflammation, immune response, and cellular survival. In our studies of the genetic network under control of the inducible NF-kappaB transcription factor, we found that the conventional ChIP technique using a single formaldehyde cross-linking step did not reproducibly cross-link it to DNA. As a result, we have developed a novel ChIP assay using a two-step cross-linking procedure, incorporating N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester-mediated protein-protein cross-linking prior to conventional DNA-protein cross-linking. We demonstrate that this technique is highly efficient, cross-linking virtually all NF-kappaB/Rel A into covalent complexes, resulting in quantitative and robust identification of inducible NF-kappaB family binding to a variety of validated NF-kappaB-dependent genomic targets. To demonstrate the general utility of this two-step cross-linking procedure, we performed enhanced capture of cytokine-inducible signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) binding to one of its known target genes. Our method represents a significant improvement in the efficiency of ChIP analysis in the study of endogenous targets for rare transcription factors.},

abstract = {Although Fe-S clusters may assemble spontaneously from elemental iron and sulfur in protein-free systems, the potential toxicity of free Fe2+, Fe3+, and S2- ions in aerobic environments underscores the requirement for specialized proteins to oversee the safe assembly of Fe-S clusters in living cells. Prokaryotes first developed multiprotein systems for Fe-S cluster assembly, from which mitochondria later derived their own system and became the main Fe-S cluster suppliers for eukaryotic cells. Early studies in yeast and human mitochondria indicated that Fe-S cluster assembly in eukaryotes is centered around highly conserved Fe-S proteins (human ISCU) that serve as scaffolds upon which new Fe-S clusters are assembled from (i) elemental sulfur, provided by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase (human NFS1) and its stabilizing-binding partner (human ISD11), and (ii) elemental iron, provided by an iron-binding protein of the frataxin family (human FXN). Further studies revealed that all of these proteins could form stable complexes that could reach molecular masses of megadaltons. However, the protein-protein interaction surfaces, catalytic mechanisms, and overall architecture of these macromolecular machines remained undefined for quite some time. The delay was due to difficulties inherent in reconstituting these very large multiprotein complexes in vitro or isolating them from cells in sufficient quantities to enable biochemical and structural studies. Here, we describe approaches we developed to reconstitute the human Fe-S cluster assembly machinery in Escherichia coli and to define its remarkable architecture.},

Here, we integrate structural, biophysical, and modeling approaches to identify the hitherto unknown substrate-binding site in TRiC and uncover the basis of substrate recognition. NMR and modeling provided a structural model of a chaperonin-substrate complex. Mutagenesis and crosslinking-mass spectrometry validated the identified substrate-binding interface and demonstrate that TRiC contacts full-length substrates combinatorially in a subunit-specific manner. The binding site of each subunit has a distinct, evolutionarily conserved pattern of polar and hydrophobic residues specifying recognition of discrete substrate motifs. The combinatorial recognition of polypeptides broadens the specificity of TRiC and may direct the topology of bound polypeptides along a productive folding trajectory, contributing to TRiC's unique ability to fold obligate substrates.},

We have previously shown that Eap binds with nanomolar affinity to complement C4b and disrupts the initial interaction between C4b and C2, thereby inhibiting formation of the classical and lectin pathway C3 pro-convertase. Although an underlying mechanism has been identified, the structural basis for Eap binding to C4b is poorly understood. Here, we show that Eap domains 3 and 4 each contain a low-affinity, but saturable binding site for C4b. Taking advantage of the high lysine content of Eap, we used a zero-length crosslinking approach to map the Eap binding site to both the a 0 -and c-chains of C4b. We also probed the C4b/Eap interface through a chemical footprinting approach involving lysine modification, proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometry. This identified seven lysines in Eap that undergo changes in solvent exposure upon C4b binding. We found that simultaneous mutation of these lysines to either alanine or glutamate diminished C4b binding and complement inhibition by Eap. Together, our results provide insight into Eap recognition of C4b, and suggest that the repeating domains that comprise Eap are capable of multiple ligand-binding modes.},

abstract = {Proteasomes are protein degradation machines that exist in cells as heterogeneous and dynamic populations. A group of proteins function as ubiquitin receptors (UbRs) that can recognize and deliver ubiquitinated substrates to proteasome complexes for degradation. Defining composition of proteasome complexes engaged with UbRs is critical to understand proteasome function. However, due to the dynamic nature of UbR interactions with the proteasome, it remains technically challenging to capture and isolate UbR-proteasome subcomplexes using conventional purification strategies. As a result, distinguishing the molecular differences among these subcomplexes remains elusive. We have developed a novel affinity purification strategy, in vivo cross-linking (X) assisted bimolecular tandem affinity purification strategy (XBAP), to effectively isolate dynamic UbR-proteasome subcomplexes and define their subunit compositions using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. In this work, we have analyzed seven distinctive UbR-proteasome complexes and found that all of them contain the same type of the 26S holocomplex. However, selected UbRs interact with a group of proteasome interacting proteins that may link each UbR to specific cellular pathways. The compositional similarities and differences among the seven UbR-proteasome subcomplexes have provided new insights on functional entities of proteasomal degradation machineries. The strategy described here represents a general and useful proteomic tool for isolating and studying dynamic and heterogeneous protein subcomplexes in cells that have not been fully characterized.},

Identification of peptides connected by a cross-link provides direct evidence for the physical interaction of amino acid side chains, information that can be used for computational modeling purposes. Despite impressive advances that were made in recent years, the number of experimentally observed cross-links still falls below the number of possible contacts of cross-linkable side chains within the span of the cross-linker. Here, we propose two complementary experimental strategies to expand cross-linking data sets. First, enrichment of cross-linked peptides by size exclusion chromatography selects cross-linked peptides based on their higher molecular mass, thereby depleting the majority of unmodified peptides present in proteolytic digests of cross-linked samples. Second, we demonstrate that the use of proteases in addition to trypsin, such as Asp-N, can additionally boost the number of observable cross-linking sites. The benefits of both SEC enrichment and multiprotease digests are demonstrated on a set of model proteins and the improved workflow is applied to the characterization of the 20S proteasome from rabbit and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.},

These include the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, RNA polymerase II, and complexes containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinases. The structure and stoichiometry of yeast R2TP and how it couples to Hsp90 are currently unknown. Here, we determine the 3D organization of yeast R2TP using sedimentation velocity analysis and cryo-electron microscopy. The 359-kDa complex comprises one Rvb1p/Rvb2p hetero-hexamer with domains II (DIIs) forming an open basket that accommodates a single copy of Tah1p-Pih1p. Tah1p-Pih1p binding to multiple DII domains regulates Rvb1p/Rvb2p ATPase activity. Using domain dissection and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we identified a unique region of Pih1p that is essential for interaction with Rvb1p/Rvb2p.

Aberrant regulation of the CSN complex has been shown to lead to tumorigenesis. Despite its biological significance, our current knowledge of the function and regulation of the CSN complex is very limited. To explore CSN biology, we have developed and employed a new version of the tag team-based QTAX strategy (quantitative analysis of tandem affinity purified in vivo cross-linked (X) protein complexes) by incorporating a label-free MS method for quantitation. Coupled with protein interaction network analysis, this strategy produced a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the protein interaction network of the human CSN complex. In total, we quantitatively characterized 825 putative CSN-interacting proteins, with 270 classified as core interactors (captured by all three bait purifications). Biochemical validation further confirms the validity of selected identified interactors. This work presents the most complete analysis of the CSN interaction network to date, providing an inclusive set of physical interaction data consistent with physiological roles for the CSN. Moreover, the methodology described here is a general proteomic tool for the comprehensive study of protein interaction networks.},

abstract = {Partitioning of the genome requires kinetochores, large protein complexes that mediate dynamic attachment of chromosomes to the spindle. Kinetochores contain two supramolecular protein assemblies. The ten-protein KMN network harbors key microtubule-binding sites in the Ndc80 complex and mediates assembly of checkpoint complexes via the KNL-1/Spc105 protein [1, 2]. As KMN does not contact DNA directly, it relies on different centromere-binding proteins for recruitment and cell-cycle-dependent assembly. These proteins are collectively referred to as the CCAN (constitutive centromere-associated network) [2–4]. The molecular mechanisms by which CCAN subunits associate, however, have remained incompletely defined. In particular, it is unclear how CCAN subunits facilitate the assembly of a microtubule-binding interface that contains multiple Ndc80 molecules bound to different receptors [5]. Here, we dissect molecular mechanisms that underlie targeting of the CCAN subunit Cnn1/CENP-T to the sequence-determined point centromeres of budding yeast. Systematic quantitative mass spectrometry experiments reveal association dependencies within the yeast CCAN network. We show that evolutionarily conserved residues in the histone-fold domain of Cnn1 are required for the formation of a stable five-subunit CCAN subassembly with the Ctf3 complex. Cnn1 localizes in a Ctf3-dependent manner to the core of the yeast point centromere, overlapping with the yeast CENP-A protein Cse4. By arranging the N-terminal domains of the CCAN subunits Mcm16, Mcm22, and Cnn1 into close proximity, the Ctf3c-Cnn1-Wip1 complex configures a composite interaction site for two molecules of the Ndc80 complex. Our experiments show how cooperative assembly mechanisms organize the microtubule-binding interface of the kinetochore.},

Rapid chemical stabilization of proteins and protein complexes through chemical cross-linking offers the alluring possibility to study details of the protein structure to function relationships as they exist within living cells. Here we apply the latest technological advances in chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry to study protein topologies and interactions from living human cells identifying a total of 368 cross-links. These include cross-links from all major cellular compartments including membrane, cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Intraprotein and interprotein cross-links were also observed for core histone proteins, including several cross-links containing post-translational modifications which are known histone marks conferring distinct epigenetic functions. Excitingly, these results demonstrate the applicability of cross-linking to make direct topological measurements on post-translationally modified proteins. The results presented here provide new details on the structures of known multi-protein complexes as well as evidence for new protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Ab initio protein-protein docking algorithms often rely on experimental data to identify the most likely complex structure. We integrated protein-protein docking with the experimental data of chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry. We tested our approach using 19 cases that resulted from an exhaustive search of the Protein Data Bank for protein complexes with cross-links identified in our experiments. We implemented cross-links as constraints based on Euclidean distance or void-volume distance. For most test cases the rank of the top-scoring near-native prediction was improved by at least two fold compared with docking without the cross-link information, and the success rate for the top 5 predictions nearly tripled. Our results demonstrate the delicate balance between retaining correct predictions and eliminating false positives. Several test cases had multiple components with distinct interfaces, and we present an approach for assigning cross-links to the interfaces. Employing the symmetry information for these cases further improved the performance of complex structure prediction.},

Here we apply mass spectrometry to the F1FO-ATPase, isolated from spinach chloroplasts, and uncover multiple modifications in soluble and membrane subunits. Mass spectra of the intact ATPase define a stable lipid 'plug' in the FO complex and reveal the stoichiometry of nucleotide binding in the F1 head. Comparing complexes formed in solution from an untreated ATPase with one incubated with a phosphatase reveals that the dephosphorylated enzyme has reduced nucleotide occupancy and decreased stability. By contrasting chemical cross-linking of untreated and dephosphorylated forms we show that cross-links are retained between the head and base, but are significantly reduced in the head, stators and stalk. Conformational changes at the catalytic interface, evidenced by changes in cross-linking, provide a rationale for reduced nucleotide occupancy and highlight a role for phosphorylation in regulating nucleotide binding and stability of the chloroplast ATPase.},

Here, we describe a novel urea-based cross-linker, which allows distinguishing different cross-linking products by collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS experiments based on characteristic product ions and constant neutral losses. The novel cross-linker is part of our ongoing efforts in developing collision-induced dissociative reagents that allow an efficient analysis of cross-linked proteins and protein complexes. Our innovative analytical concept is exemplified for the Munc13-1 peptide and the recombinantly expressed ligand binding domain of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, for which cross-linking reaction mixtures were analyzed both by offline nano-HPLC/MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and by online nano-HPLC/nano-ESI-LTQ-orbitrap mass spectrometry. The characteristic fragment ion patterns of the novel cross-linker greatly simplify the identification of different cross-linked species, namely, modified peptides as well as intrapeptide and interpeptide cross-links, from complex mixtures and drastically reduce the potential of identifying false-positive cross-links. Our novel urea-based CID cleavable cross-linker is expected to be highly advantageous for analyzing protein 3D structures and protein-protein complexes in an automated manner.},

Unlike structural analysis of proteins using chemical reagents specific for lysine or cysteine residues, identification of gas-phase fragmentation patterns of endogenous dityrosine cross-linked peptides have not been investigated. Dityrosine cross-linking in proteins and peptides are clinical markers of oxidative stress, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated and characterized the fragmentation pattern of a synthetically prepared dityrosine cross-linked dimer of A{\$}\beta{\$}(1−16) using ESI tandem mass spectrometry. We then detailed the fragmentation pattern of dityrosine cross-linked A{\$}\beta{\$}(1−16), using collision induced dissociation (CID), higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and electron capture dissociation (ECD). Application of these generic fragmentation rules of dityrosine cross-linked peptides allowed for the identification of dityrosine cross-links in peptides of A{\$}\beta{\$} and {\$}\alpha{\$}-synuclein generated in vitro by enzymatic peroxidation. We report, for the first time, the dityrosine cross-linked residues in human hemoglobin and {\$}\alpha{\$}-synuclein under oxidative conditions.

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are in many respects very similar to real experiments. In MD, first, sample is prepared, a model system consisting of N particles is selected, and then Newton's equations of motion are solved for the system until the properties of the system no longer change with time. To measure an observable quantity in a MD simulation, one must first of all be able to express this observable as a function of the positions and momenta of the particles in the system. The best introduction to MD simulations is to consider a simple program. To start the simulation, one should assign initial positions and velocities to all particles in the system. The particle positions should be chosen compatible with the structure that one is aiming to simulate. A good MD program requires a good algorithm to integrate Newton's equations of motion. Accuracy for large time steps is more important because the longer the time step that one can use, the fewer evaluations of the forces are needed per unit of simulation time. For most MD applications, Verlet-like algorithms are perfectly adequate. However, sometimes it is convenient to employ a higher-order algorithm.},

abstract = {CID-MS/MS cleavable cross-linkers hold an enormous potential for an automated analysis of cross-linked products, which is essential for conducting structural proteomics studies. The created characteristic fragment ion patterns can easily be used for an automated assignment and discrimination of cross-linked products. To date, there are only a few software solutions available that make use of these properties, but none allows for an automated analysis of cleavable cross-linked products. The MeroX software fills this gap and presents a powerful tool for protein 3D-structure analysis in combination with MS/MS cleavable cross-linkers. We show that MeroX allows an automatic screening of characteristic fragment ions, considering static and variable peptide modifications, and effectively scores different types of cross-links. No manual input is required for a correct assignment of cross-links and false discovery rates are calculated. The self-explanatory graphical user interface of MeroX provides easy access for an automated cross-link search platform that is compatible with commonly used data file formats, enabling analysis of data originating from different instruments. The combination of an MS/MS cleavable cross-linker with a dedicated software tool for data analysis provides an automated workflow for 3D-structure analysis of proteins.

abstract = {RATIONALE: Chemical cross-linking in combination with a mass spectrometric analysis of the created cross-linked products is an area of growing interest for deriving low-resolution structural information of proteins and protein complexes. One of the greatest challenges is the complexity of the created cross-linking mixtures, which can be met by a charge-based enrichment of cross-linked peptides after proteolytic digestion using strong cation-exchange (SCX) chromatography. METHODS: SCX chromatography was used for the enrichment of cross-linked peptides with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) succinate (BS3) prior to a mass spectrometric analysis by nano-HPLC/nano-ESI-LTQOrbitrap- MS/MS. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were employed as model proteins. RESULTS: Conditions for SCX enrichment were optimized for obtaining as many interpeptide cross-linked peptides as possible in order to maximize the amount of structural information from a single experiment. With an SCX-based enrichment step of cross-linked products within BSA using the cross-linker BS3, 154 interpeptidal cross-linking products were identified during nano-HPLC/nano-ESI-MS/MS analyses, whereas analyses without a prior SCX enrichment allowed the identification of merely 20 cross-linked products. The application of the SCX enrichment strategy for the analysis of cross-linked products of GST with BS3 allowed the identification of 26 interpeptidal cross-linked products compared with 16 without SCX enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: For both proteins investigated herein, BSA and GST, the introduction of an SCX-based enrichment step prior to nano-HPLC/nano-ESI-MS/MS of cross-linked products led to a considerable gain in structural information.

The metazoan-specific ≈800-kD ROD–Zwilch–ZW10 (RZZ) complex builds a fibrous corona that assembles on mitotic kinetochores before MT attachment to promote chromosome alignment and robust spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. In this study, we combine biochemical reconstitutions, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and structural modeling to build a complete model of human RZZ. We find that RZZ is structurally related to self-assembling cytosolic coat scaffolds that mediate membrane cargo trafficking, including Clathrin, Sec13–Sec31, and {\$}\alpha{\$}{\$}\beta{\$}'{\$}\epsilon{\$}-COP. We show that Spindly, a dynein adaptor, is related to BicD2 and binds RZZ directly in a farnesylation-dependent but membrane-independent manner.

The structure of C3(H2O) has not been determined. Here we subjected C3(H2O) to quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry (QCLMS). This revealed details of the structural differences and similarities between C3(H2O) and C3, as well as between C3(H2O) and its pivotal proteolytic cleavage product, C3b, which shares functionally similarity with C3(H2O). Considered in combination with the crystal structures of C3 and C3b, the QCMLS data suggest that C3(H2O) generation is accompanied by the migration of the thioester-containing domain of C3 from one end of the molecule to the other. This creates a stable C3b-like platform able to bind the zymogen, factor B, or the regulator, factor H. Integration of available crystallographic and QCLMS data allowed the determination of a 3D model of the C3(H2O) domain architecture. The unique arrangement of domains thus observed in C3(H2O), which retains the anaphylatoxin domain (that is excised when C3 is enzymatically activated to C3b), can be used to rationalize observed differences between C3(H2O) and C3b in terms of complement activation and regulation.},

abstract = {Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry has proven useful for studying protein-protein interactions and protein structure, however the low resolution of cross-linking has so far precluded its use in determining structures de novo. Cross-linking resolution has been typically limited by the chemical selectivity of the standard cross-linking reagents that are commonly used for protein cross-linking. We have implemented the use of a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent, sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4'-azipentanoate (sulfo-SDA), combining a traditional sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) ester and a UV photoactivatable diazirine group. This diazirine yields a highly reactive and promiscuous carbene species, the net result being a greatly increased number of cross-links compared with homobifunctional, NHS-based cross-linkers. We present a novel methodology that combines the use of this high-resolution photo-cross-linking with conformational space search to investigate the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, from purified samples, and in it's native environment, human blood serum. Our approach is able to determine HSA domain structures with good accuracy: RMSD to crystal structure are 2.8/5.6/2.9 {\AA}(purified samples) and 4.5/5.9/4.8 {\AA}(serum samples) for domains A/B/C for the first selected structure; 2.5/4.9/2.9 {\AA}(purified samples) and 3.5/5.2/3.8 {\AA}(serum samples) for the best out of top five selected structures. Our proof-of-concept study on HSA demonstrates initial potential of our approach for determining the structures of more proteins in the complex biological contexts in which they function and which they may require for correct folding.

abstract = {Higher-order multi-protein complexes such as RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complexes with transcription initiation factors are often not amenable to X-ray structure determination. Here, we show that protein cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) has now sufficiently advanced as a tool to extend the Pol II structure to a 15-subunit, 670 kDa complex of Pol II with the initiation factor TFIIF at peptide resolution. The N-terminal regions of TFIIF subunits Tfg1 and Tfg2 form a dimerization domain that binds the Pol II lobe on the Rpb2 side of the active centre cleft near downstream DNA. The C-terminal winged helix (WH) domains of Tfg1 and Tfg2 are mobile, but the Tfg2 WH domain can reside at the Pol II protrusion near the predicted path of upstream DNA in the initiation complex. The linkers between the dimerization domain and the WH domains in Tfg1 and Tfg2 are located to the jaws and protrusion, respectively. The results suggest how TFIIF suppresses non-specific DNA binding and how it helps to recruit promoter DNA and to set the transcription start site.

abstract = {The cross-linking Mass Spectrometry (XL-MS) technique extracts structural information from protein complexes without requiring highly purified samples, crystallinity, or large amounts of material. However, there are challenges to applying the technique to protein complexes in vitro, and those challenges become more daunting with in vivo experiments. Issues include effective detection and identification of cross-linked peptides from complex mixtures. While MS-cleavable cross-linkers facilitate the sequencing and identification of cross-linked peptides, enrichable cross-linkers increase their detectability by allowing their separation from non-cross-linked peptides prior to MS analysis. Although a number of cross-linkers with single functionality have been developed in recent years, an ideal reagent would incorporate both capabilities for XL-MS studies. Therefore, two new cross-linkers have been designed and prepared that incorporate an azide (azide-A-DSBSO) or alkyne (alkyne-A-DSBSO) to enable affinity purification strat- egies based on click chemistry. The integration of an acid cleavage site next to the enrichment handle allows easy recovery of cross-linked products during affinity purification. In addition, these sulfoxide con- taining cross-linking reagents possess robust MS-cleavable bonds to facilitate fast and easy identification of cross-linked peptides using MS analysis. Optimized, gram-scale syntheses of these cross-linkers have been developed and the azide-A-DSBSO cross-linker has been evaluated with peptides and proteins to demonstrate its utility in XL-MS analysis.

We report the results of a combined approach of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics to two human complexes containing large coiled-coil segments, the NDEL1 homodimer and the NDC80 heterotetramer. An important limitation of the cross-linking approach, so far, was the identification of cross-linked peptides from fragmentation spectra. Our novel approach overcomes the data analysis bottleneck of cross-linking and mass spectrometry. We constructed a purpose-built database to match spectra with cross-linked peptides, define a score that expresses the quality of our identification, and estimate false positive rates. We show that our analysis sheds light on critical structural parameters such as the directionality of the homodimeric coiled coil of NDEL1, the register of the heterodimeric coiled coils of the NDC80 complex, and the organization of a tetramerization region in the NDC80 complex. Our approach is especially useful to address complexes that are difficult in addressing by standard structural methods.},

Until now, it was accepted that the CSN is composed of eight canonical components. Here, we report the discovery of an additional integral and stoichiometric subunit that had thus far evaded detection, and we named it CSNAP (CSN acidic protein). We show that CSNAP binds CSN3, CSN5, and CSN6, and its incorporation into the CSN complex is mediated through the C-terminal region involving conserved aromatic residues. Moreover, depletion of this small protein leads to reduced proliferation and a flattened and enlarged morphology. Finally, on the basis of sequence and structural properties shared by both CSNAP and DSS1, a component of the related 19S lid proteasome complex, we propose that CSNAP, the ninth CSN subunit, is the missing paralogous subunit of DSS1.

Here we show that mass spectrometry can also be used in order to define the spatial organization of these complexes. In this approach, components of a protein complex are purified via molecular interactions using an affinity tagged member and the purified complex is then partially cross-linked. The products are separated by gel electrophoresis and their constituent components identified by mass spectrometry yielding nearest-neighbor relationships. In this study, a member of the yeast nuclear pore complex (Nup85p) was tagged and a six-member sub-complex of the pore was cross-linked and analyzed by 1D SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking reactions were optimized for yield and number of products. Analysis by MALDI mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of protein constituents in the cross-linked bands even at a level of a few hundred femtomoles. Based on these results, a model of the spatial organization of the complex was derived that was later supported by biological experiments. This work demonstrates, that the use of mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analyzing cross-linking experiments aiming on nearest neighbor relationships.},

RP biogenesis culminates with the joining of two large subcomplexes, the lid and base. In yeast and mammals, the lid appears to assemble completely before attaching to the base, but how this hierarchical assembly is enforced has remained unclear. Using biochemical reconstitutions, quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy, we resolve the mechanistic basis for the linkage between lid biogenesis and lid-base joining. Assimilation of the final lid subunit, Rpn12, triggers a large-scale conformational remodeling of the nascent lid that drives RP assembly, in part by relieving steric clash with the base. Surprisingly, this remodeling is triggered by a single Rpn12 ?? helix. Such assembly-coupled conformational switching is reminiscent of viral particle maturation and may represent a commonly used mechanism to enforce hierarchical assembly in multisubunit complexes.},

However, the binding interface between apoE and A{\$}\beta{\$} is poorly defined despite substantial previous research efforts, and the exact role of apoE in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease remains largely elusive.

Chemical crosslinking followed by the mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked peptides (XL-MS) identifies contact sites between residues within a single or between multiple proteins. The application of XL-MS to many biologically relevant molecular machines has been shown, with a rapidly growing number of successful studies reported in the past 2-3 years. Crosslinking data are useful in integrative modeling workflows by providing distance restraints on the surface of folded proteins and complexes.

abstract = {We present results from a novel strategy that enables concurrent identification of protein-protein interactions and topologies in living cells without specific antibodies or genetic manipulations for immuno-/affinity purifications. The strategy consists of (i) a chemical cross-linking reaction: intact cell labeling with a novel class of chemical cross-linkers, protein interaction reporters (PIRs); (ii) two-stage mass spectrometric analysis: stage 1 identification of PIR-labeled proteins and construction of a restricted database by two-dimensional LC/MSMS and stage 2 analysis of PIR-labeled peptides by multiplexed LC/FTICR-MS; and (iii) data analysis: identification of cross-linked peptides and proteins of origin using accurate mass and other constraints. The primary advantage of the PIR approach and distinction from current technology is that protein interactions together with topologies are detected in native biological systems by stabilizing protein complexes with new covalent bonds while the proteins are present in the original cellular environment. Thus, weak or transient interactions or interactions that require properly folded, localized, or membrane-bound proteins can be labeled and identified through the PIR approach. This strategy was applied to Shewanella oneidensis bacterial cells, and initial studies resulted in identification of a set of protein-protein interactions and their contact/binding regions. Furthermore most identified interactions involved membrane proteins, suggesting that the PIR approach is particularly suited for studies of membrane protein-protein interactions, an area under-represented with current widely used approaches.},

abstract = {A new mass spectrometry identifiable cross-linking strategy has been developed to study protein-protein interactions. The new cross-linker was designed to have two low-energy MS/MS-cleavable bonds in the spacer chain to provide three primary benefits: First, a reporter tag can be released from cross-link due to cleavage of the two labile bonds in the spacer chain. Second, a relatively simple MS/MS spectrum can be generated owing to favorable cleavage of labile bonds. And finally, the cross-linked peptide chains are dissociated from each other, and each then can be fragmented separately to get sequence information. Therefore, this novel type of cross-linker was named protein interaction reporter (PIR). To this end, two RINK groups were utilized to make our first-generation cross-linker using solid-phase peptide synthesis chemistry. The RINK group contains a bond more labile than peptide bonds during low-energy activation. The new cross-linker was applied to cross-link ribonuclease S (RNase S), a noncovalent complex of S-peptide and S-protein. The results demonstrated that the new cross-linker effectively reacted with RNase S to generate various types of cross-linked products. More importantly, the cross-linked peptides successfully released reporter ions during selective MS/MS conditions, and the dissociated peptide chains remained intact during MS(2), thus enabling MS(3) to be performed subsequently. In addition, dead-end, intra-, and inter-cross-linked peptides can be distinguished by analyzing MS/MS spectra.},

Previous application of a mass spectrometry-compatible cross-linker to preparations of the luteovirid Potato leafroll virus (PLRV; Luteoviridae: Polerovirus) revealed a detailed network of interactions between viral structural proteins and enabled generation of the first cross-linking guided coat protein models. In this study, we extended application of chemical cross-linking technology to the related Turnip yellows virus (TuYV; Luteoviridae: Polerovirus). Remarkably, all cross-links found between sites in the viral coat protein found for TuYV were also found in PLRV. Guided by these data, we present two models for the TuYV coat protein trimer, the basic structural unit of luteovirid virions. Additional cross-links found between the TuYV coat protein and a site in the viral protease domain suggest a possible role for the luteovirid protease in regulating the structural biology of these viruses.},

abstract = {Through protein degradation, the proteasome plays fundamental roles in different cell compartments. Although the composition of the 20S catalytic core particle (CP) has been well documented, little is known about the composition and dynamics of the regulatory complexes that play a crucial role in its activity, or about how they associate with the CP in different cell compartments, different cell lines, and in response to external stimuli. Because of difficulties performing acceptable cell fractionation while maintaining complex integrity, it has been challenging to characterize proteasome complexes by proteomic approaches. Here, we report an integrated protocol, combining a cross-linking procedure on intact cells with cell fractionation, proteasome immuno-purification, and robust label-free quantitative proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry to determine the distribution and dynamics of cellular proteasome complexes in leukemic cells. Activity profiles of proteasomes were correlated fully with the composition of protein complexes and stoichiometry. Moreover, our results suggest that, at the subcellular level, proteasome function is regulated by dynamic interactions between the 20S CP and its regulatory proteins-which modulate proteasome activity, stability, localization, or substrate uptake-rather than by profound changes in 20S CP composition. Proteasome plasticity was observed both in the 20S CP and in its network of interactions following IFN{\$}\gamma{\$} stimulation. The fractionation protocol also revealed specific proteolytic activities and structural features of low-abundance microsomal proteasomes from U937 and KG1a cells. These could be linked to their important roles in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway in leukemic cells.},

We demonstrate our method by testing it on known structures and available crosslinking data. We also crosslinked and modeled the 17-subunit yeast RNA polymerase III at atomic resolution; the resulting model agrees remarkably well with recently published cryoelectron microscopy structures and provides additional insights into the polymerase structure.},

To resolve the regions that are less well defined in cryo-EM images, cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CX-MS) provides valuable information on the proximity between amino-acid residues as distance constraints for homology or de novo modelling. The CX-MS strategy involves covalent linkage, with chemical cross-linkers, of residues close to each other in three-dimensional space and identifying these connections by mass spectrometry.

The major challenge in cross-linking approaches is the complexity of the mass spectrometric data. New approaches are required that can identify cross-linked peptides with high-confidence and establish a user-friendly analysis protocol for the biomedical scientific community. Here, we introduce a novel cross-linker that can be selectively cleaved in the gas phase using two differential tandem mass-spectrometric fragmentation methods, such as collision-induced or electron transfer dissociation (CID and ETD). This technique produces two signature mass spectra of the same cross-linked peptide, thereby producing high confidence in identifying the sites of interaction. Further tandem mass spectrometry can also give additional confidence on the peptide sequences. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept for this method using standard peptides and proteins. Peptides and proteins were cross-linked and their fragmentation characteristics were analyzed using CID and ETD tandem mass spectrometry. Two sequential cleavages unambiguously identified cross-linked peptides. In addition, the labeling efficiency of the new cross-linker was evaluated in macrophage immune cells after stimulation with the microbial ligand lipopolysaccharide and subsequent pulldown experiments with biotin-avidin affinity chromatography. We believe this strategy will help advance insights into the structural biology and systems biology of cell signaling. },

Although the low-resolution topology search module was able to sample models with a global distance test total score (GDT{\_}TS) value greater than 30{\%} for twelve out of twenty proteins, frequently it was not possible to select the most accurate models for refinement, resulting in a general decay of model quality over the course of the prediction pipeline.

abstract = {We describe an integrated workflow that robustly identifies cross-links from endogenous protein complexes in human cellular lysates. Our approach is based on the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-cleavable cross-linkers, sequential collision-induced dissociation (CID)-tandem MS (MS/MS) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)-MS/MS acquisitions, and a dedicated search engine, XlinkX, which allows rapid cross-link identification against a complete human proteome database. This approach allowed us to detect 2,426 unique cross-links at a 5{\%} FDR (2,013 intraprotein and 413 interprotein cross-links) or 1,822 cross-links at a 1{\%} FDR (1,622 intraprotein and 200 interprotein cross-links), indicating the detection of 326 or 134 protein-protein interactions at 5{\%} FDR or 1{\%} FDR, respectively, in HeLa cell lysates. We validated the confidence of our cross-linking results by using a target-decoy strategy and mapping the observed cross-link distances onto existing high-resolution structures. Our data provided new structural information about many protein assemblies and captured dynamic interactions of the ribosome in contact with different elongation factors.},

abstract = {Structural characterization of proteasome complexes is an essential step toward understanding the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Currently, high resolution structures are not available for the 26S proteasome holocomplex as well as its subcomplex, the 19S regulatory particle (RP). Here we have employed a novel integrated strategy combining chemical cross- linking with multistage tandem mass spectrometry to define the proximity of subunits within the yeast 19S RP in order to elucidate its topology. This has resulted in the identification of 174 cross-linked peptides of the yeast 19S RP, representing 43 unique lysine-lysine linkages within 24 non-redundant pair-wise subunit interactions. To map the spatial organization of the 19S RP, we have developed and utilized a rigorous probabilistic framework to derive maximum likelihood (ML) topologies based on cross-linked peptides determined from our cross-linking analysis. Probabilistic modeling of the yeast 19S hexameric AAA-ATPase ring (i.e. Rpt1-6) has produced an ML topology which is in excellent agreement with known topologies of its orthologs. In addition, similar analysis was carried out on the 19S lid subcomplex, whose predicted ML topology corroborates recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. Together, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and potential of probabilistic modeling for unraveling topologies of protein complexes using cross-linking data. This report describes the first study of the 19S RP topology using a new integrated strategy combining chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry and probabilistic modeling. Our results have provided a solid foundation to advance our understanding of the 19S RP architecture at peptide- level resolution. Furthermore, our methodology developed here is a valuable proteomic tool that can be generalized for elucidating the structures of protein complexes.},

@article{Petrotchenko2014,
abstract = {SDS-PAGE is one of the most powerful protein separation techniques, and in-gel digestion is the leading method for converting proteins separated by SDS-PAGE into peptides suitable for mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies. In in-gel digestion, proteins are digested within the gel matrix, and the resulting peptides are extracted into an appropriate buffer. Transfer of the digested peptides to the liquid phase for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis, however, may be hampered by peptide-specific characteristics, including size, shape, poor solubility, adsorption to the polyacrylamide, and-in the case of cross-linking applications-by the branched structure of the peptides produced. This can be a limitation in cross-linking studies where efficient recoveries of the cross-linked peptides are critical. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a modification to the standard in-gel digestion procedure for SDS-PAGE-separated cross-linked proteins, based on older passive diffusion methods. By omitting the gel staining and gel fixation steps, intact proteins or cross-linked protein complexes can move through the gel and into the buffer solution. Digestion of the entire protein in the buffer outside the gel increases the probability that most of the proteolytic peptides produced will be present in the final digest solution. The resulting peptide mixture is then freed of SDS and concentrated using SCX (strong cation exchange) zip-tips and analyzed by mass spectrometry. For standard protein identification studies and the recovery of noncross-linked peptides, the in-gel procedure outperformed the out-gel procedure, but for cross-linking studies with enrichable cross-linkers (such as CBDPS), the standard out-gel procedure allowed the recoveries of cross-links not recovered via the in-gel method. Labeling experiments showed that, with an enrichable cross-linker, 93{\%} of the cross-links showed better or equal recoveries with the out-gel procedure, as compared to the in-gel procedure. It should be noted that this method is not designed to replace in-gel digestion for most proteomics applications. However, by using the out-gel method, we were able to detect twice as many interprotein CBDPS cross-links from the histone H2A/H2B complex as were found in the in-gel digested sample.},

However, despite a recent partial reconstitution of the human Augmin complex in vitro, the molecular basis of this recruitment remains unclear. Here, we used immuno-affinity purification of in vivo Augmin from Drosophila and cross-linking/mass spectrometry to identify distance restraints between residues within the eight Augmin subunits in the absence of any other structural information. The results allowed us to predict potential interfaces between Augmin and {\$}\gamma{\$}-TuRC. We tested these predictions biochemically and in the Drosophila embryo, demonstrating that specific regions of the Augmin subunits, Dgt3, Dgt5 and Dgt6 all directly bind the {\$}\gamma{\$}-TuRC protein, Dgp71WD, and are required for the accumulation of {\$}\gamma{\$}-TuRC, but not Augmin, to the mitotic spindle. This study therefore substantially increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning MT-dependent MT nucleation.},

Typically, these experiments have been challenging to carry out, often utilizing non-standard methods to fully identify cross-linked peptides. Mango is an open source software tool that extracts precursor masses from chimeric spectra generated using cleavable cross-linkers, greatly simplifying the downstream search. As it is designed to work with chimeric spectra, Mango can be used on traditional high-resolution MS/MS capable mass spectrometers without the need for additional modifications. When paired with a traditional proteomics search engine, Mango can be used to identify several thousand cross-linked peptide pairs searching against the entire E.coli proteome. Mango provides an avenue to perform whole proteome cross-linking experiments without specialized instrumentation or access to non-standard methods.},

In proteins of known structure, crosslinks were found only between loops residing on the same side of the membrane. As may be expected, crosslinks were mainly found in very abundant proteins.

This prevents automatically quantifying other m/z features in a targeted manner including those associated with cross-linked peptides. Here we present a new release of MaxQuant that permits starting the quantification process from an m/z feature list. Comparing the automated quantification to a carefully manually curated test set of cross-linked peptides obtained by cross-linking C3 and C3b with BS3 and isotope-labeled BS3-d4 revealed a number of observations: 1) Fully automated process using MaxQuant can quantify cross-links in our reference dataset with 68{\%} recall rate and 88{\%} accuracy. 2) Hidden quantification errors can be converted into exposed failures by label-swap replica, which makes label-swap replica an essential part of QCLMS. 3) Cross-links that failed during automated quantification can be recovered by semi-automated re-quantification. The integrated workflow of MaxQuant and semi-automated assessment provides the maximum of quantified cross-links. In contrast, work on larger data sets or by less experienced users will benefit from full automation in MaxQuant.},

abstract = {Laminin, an ∼800-kDa heterotrimeric protein, is a major functional component of the extracellular matrix, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. The unique architecture of laminin is not currently amenable to determination at high resolution, as its flexible and narrow segments complicate both crystallization and single-particle reconstruction by electron microscopy. Therefore, we used cross-linking and MS, evaluated using computational methods, to address key questions regarding laminin quaternary structure. This approach was particularly well suited to the ∼750-{\AA}coiled coil that mediates trimer assembly, and our results support revision of the subunit order typically presented in laminin schematics. Furthermore, information on the subunit register in the coiled coil and cross-links to downstream domains provide insights into the self-assembly required for interaction with other extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins.},

abstract = {Ab initio protein-protein docking algorithms often rely on experimental data to identify the most likely complex structure. We integrated protein-protein docking with the experimental data of chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry. We tested our approach using 19 cases that resulted from an exhaustive search of the Protein Data Bank for protein complexes with cross-links identified in our experiments. We implemented cross-links as constraints based on Euclidean distance or void-volume distance. For most test cases the rank of the top-scoring near-native prediction was improved by at least two fold compared with docking without the cross-link information, and the success rate for the top 5 predictions nearly tripled. Our results demonstrate the delicate balance between retaining correct predictions and eliminating false positives. Several test cases had multiple components with distinct interfaces, and we present an approach for assigning cross-links to the interfaces. Employing the symmetry information for these cases further improved the performance of complex structure prediction.},

abstract = {Protein interaction topologies are critical determinants of biological function. Large-scale or proteome-wide measurements of protein interaction topologies in cells currently pose an unmet challenge that could dramatically improve understanding of complex biological systems. A primary impediment includes direct protein topology and interaction measurements from living systems since interactions that lack biological significance may be introduced during cell lysis. Furthermore, many biologically relevant protein interactions will likely not survive the lysis/sample preparation and may only be measured with in vivo methods. As a step toward meeting this challenge, a new mass spectrometry method called Real-time Analysis for Cross-linked peptide Technology (ReACT) has been developed that enables assignment of cross-linked peptides "on-the-fly". Using ReACT, 708 unique cross-linked ({\textless}5{\%} FDR) peptide pairs were identified from cross-linked E. coli cells. These data allow assembly of the first protein interaction network that also contains topological features of every interaction, as it existed in cells during cross-linker application. Of the identified interprotein cross-linked peptide pairs, 40{\%} are derived from known interactions and provide new topological data that can help visualize how these interactions exist in cells. Other identified cross-linked peptide pairs are from proteins known to be involved within the same complex, but yield newly discovered direct physical interactors. ReACT enables the first view of these interactions inside cells, and the results acquired with this method suggest cross-linking can play a major role in future efforts to map the interactome in cells.},

However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked or XL) peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge. Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated through commonly used cross-linkers (e.g., BS3/DSS). Our software introduces a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2D interaction map and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a data set obtained from the human HSP90. The software is freely available for academic use at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl. A video demonstrating the tool is available at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl/video.

abstract = {Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone matrix, has been demonstrated to inhibit bone growth by gene knockout experiments (Ducy, P., Desbois, C., Boyce, B., Pinero, G., Story, B., Dunstan, C., Smith, E., Bonadio, J., Goldstein, S., Gundberg, C., Bradley, A., and Karsenty, G. (1996) Nature 382, 448-452). Its specific functional mechanism in bone metabolism is, however, largely unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that osteocalcin has an inhibitory effect on tissue transglutaminase activity, as measured by cross-linking of osteopontin, another bone matrix protein. Using a set of synthetic peptides, we found that the inhibitory activity resided within the first 13 N-terminal amino acid residues of osteocalcin. An N-terminal peptide also inhibited cross-linking of another tissue transglutaminase substrate, beta-casein. The inhibitory peptide was shown to have affinity for the substrates of transglutaminase rather than for the enzyme. Since the N terminus of osteocalcin exhibits homology to the substrate recognition site sequences of two transglutaminases, we conclude that the inhibitory effect is most likely due to competition with the enzyme for the transglutaminase-binding region of the substrates, osteopontin and beta-casein, which prevents access of the enzyme to them to perform its function. The interference of osteocalcin with osteopontin cross-linking gives osteocalcin a new potential function as the first protein inhibitor of tissue transglutaminase. This suggests a specific role and a plausible mechanism for it as a modulator of maturation, stabilization, and calcification of bone matrix.},

abstract = {Dynamic proteins and multi-protein complexes govern most biological processes. Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) is increasingly successful in providing residue-resolution data on static proteinaceous structures. Here we investigate the technical feasibility of recording dynamic processes using isotope-labelling for quantitation. We cross-linked human serum albumin (HSA) with the readily available cross-linker BS3-d0/4 in different heavy/light ratios. We found two limitations. First, isotope labelling reduced the number of identified cross-links. This is in line with similar findings when identifying proteins. Second, standard quantitative proteomics software was not suitable for work with cross-linking. To ameliorate this we wrote a basic open source application, XiQ. Using XiQ we could establish that quantitative CLMS was technically feasible. Biological significance: Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) has become a powerful tool for providing residue-resolution data on static proteinaceous structures. Adding quantitation to CLMS will extend its ability of recording dynamic processes. Here we introduce a cross-linking specific quantitation strategy by using isotope labelled cross-linkers. Using a model system, we demonstrate the principle and feasibility of quantifying cross-linking data and discuss challenges one may encounter while doing so. We then provide a basic open source application, XiQ, to carry out automated quantitation of CLMS data. Our work lays the foundations of studying the molecular details of biological processes at greater ease than this could be done so far.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: New Horizons and Applications for Proteomics [EuPA 2012].},

In the resulting model of Pol I, the C-terminal ribbon (C-ribbon) domain of A12.2 reaches the active site via the polymerase pore, like the C-ribbon of the Pol II cleavage factor TFIIS, explaining why the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I is strong, in contrast to the weak cleavage activity of Pol II. The A49/34.5 dimerization module resides on the polymerase lobe, like TFIIF, whereas the A49 tWH domain resides above the cleft, resembling parts of TFIIE.

abstract = {We describe the detailed structural investigation of nidogen-1/laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 complexes using full-length nidogen-1 and a number of laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 variants. The interactions of nidogen-1 with laminin variants {\$}\gamma{\$}1 LEb2-4, {\$}\gamma{\$}1 LEb2-4 N836D, {\$}\gamma{\$}1 short arm, and {\$}\gamma{\$}1 short arm N836D were investigated by applying a combination of (photo-)chemical cross-linking, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational modeling. In addition, surface plasmon resonance and ELISA studies were used to determine kinetic constants of the nidogen-1/laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 interaction. Two complementary cross-linking strategies were pursued to analyze solution structures of laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 variants and nidogen-1. The majority of distance information was obtained with the homobifunctional amine-reactive cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)glutarate. In a second approach, UV-induced cross-linking was performed after incorporation of the diazirine-containing unnatural amino acids photo-leucine and photo-methionine into laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 LEb2-4, laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 short arm, and nidogen-1. Our results indicate that Asn-836 within laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 LEb3 domain is not essential for complex formation. Cross-links between laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 short arm and nidogen-1 were found in all protein regions, evidencing several additional contact regions apart from the known interaction site. Computational modeling based on the cross-linking constraints indicates the existence of a conformational ensemble of both the individual proteins and the nidogen-1/laminin {\$}\gamma{\$}1 complex. This finding implies different modes of interaction resulting in several distinct protein-protein interfaces.},

abstract = {Calreticulin is a highly conserved multifunctional protein implicated in many different biological systems and has therefore been the subject of intensive research. It is primarily present in the endoplasmatic reticulum where its main functions are to regulate Ca2??+ homeostasis, act as a chaperone and stabilize the MHC class I peptide-loading complex. Although several high-resolution structures of calreticulin exist, these only cover three-quarters of the entire protein leaving the extended structures unsolved. Additionally, the structure of calreticulin is influenced by the presence of Ca2??+. The conformational changes induced by Ca2??+ have not been determined yet as they are hard to study with traditional approaches. Here, we investigated the Ca2??+-induced conformational changes with a combination of chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics analysis and modelling in Rosetta. Using a bifunctional linker, we found a large Ca2??+-induced change to the cross-linking pattern in calreticulin. Our results are consistent with a high flexibility in the P-loop, a stabilization of the acidic C-terminal and a relatively close interaction of the P-loop and the acidic C-terminal. Biological significance The function of calreticulin, an endoplasmatic reticulin chaperone, is affected by fluctuations in Ca2??+??concentration, but the structural mechanism is unknown. The present work suggests that Ca2??+-dependent regulation is caused by different conformations of a long proline-rich loop that changes the accessibility to the peptide/lectin-binding site. Our results indicate that the binding of Ca2??+ to calreticulin may thus not only just be a question of Ca2??+ storage but is likely to have an impact on the chaperone activity.},

abstract = {Adaptor proteins assist proteases in degrading specific proteins under appropriate conditions. The adaptor protein YjbH promotes the degradation of an important global transcriptional regulator Spx, which controls the expression of hundreds of genes and operons in response to thiol-specific oxidative stress in Bacillus subtilis. Under normal growth conditions, the transcription factor is bound to the adaptor protein and therefore degraded by the AAA+ protease ClpXP. If this binding is alleviated during stress, the transcription factor accumulates and turns on genes encoding stress-alleviating proteins. The adaptor protein YjbH is thus a key player involved in these interactions but its structure is unknown. To gain insight into its structure and interactions we have used chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry. Distance constraints obtained from the crosslinked monomer were used to select and validate a structure model of YjbH and then to probe its interactions with other proteins. The core structure of YjbH is reminiscent of DsbA family proteins. One lysine residue in YjbH (K177), located in one of the alpha-helices outside the thioredoxin fold, crosslinked to both Spx K99 and Spx K117, thereby suggesting one side of the YjbH for the interaction with Spx. Another lysine residue that crosslinked to Spx was YjbH K5, located in the long and presumably very flexible N-terminal arm of YjbH. Our crosslinking data lend support to a model proposed based on site-directed mutagenesis where the YjbH interaction with Spx can stabilize and present the C-terminal region of Spx for protease recognition and proteolysis.

abstract = {Cell growth is regulated during RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription initiation by the conserved factor Rrn3/TIF-IA in yeast/humans. Here we provide a structure-function analysis of Rrn3 based on a combination of structural biology with in vivo and in vitro functional assays. The Rrn3 crystal structure reveals a unique HEAT repeat fold and a surface serine patch. Phosphorylation of this patch represses human Pol I transcription, and a phospho-mimetic patch mutation prevents Rrn3 binding to Pol I in vitro and reduces cell growth and Pol I gene occupancy in vivo. Cross-linking indicates that Rrn3 binds Pol I between its subcomplexes, AC40/19 and A14/43, which faces the serine patch. The corresponding region of Pol II binds the Mediator head that cooperates with transcription factor (TF) IIB. Consistent with this, the Rrn3-binding factor Rrn7 is predicted to be a TFIIB homolog. This reveals the molecular basis of Rrn3-regulated Pol I initiation and cell growth, and indicates a general architecture of eukaryotic transcription initiation complexes.},

abstract = {Most cellular processes are orchestrated by macromolecular complexes. However, structural elucidation of these endogenous complexes can be challenging because they frequently contain large numbers of proteins, are compositionally and morphologically heterogeneous, can be dynamic, and are often of low abundance in the cell. Here, we present a strategy for the structural characterization of such complexes that has at its center chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometric readout. In this strategy, we isolate the endogenous complexes using a highly optimized sample preparation protocol and generate a comprehensive, high-quality cross-linking dataset using two complementary cross-linking reagents. We then determine the structure of the complex using a refined integrative method that combines the cross-linking data with information generated from other sources, including electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and comparative protein structure modeling. We applied this integrative strategy to determine the structure of the native Nup84 complex, a stable hetero-heptameric assembly (∼ 600 kDa), 16 copies of which form the outer rings of the 50-MDa nuclear pore complex (NPC) in budding yeast. The unprecedented detail of the Nup84 complex structure reveals previously unseen features in its pentameric structural hub and provides information on the conformational flexibility of the assembly. These additional details further support and augment the protocoatomer hypothesis, which proposes an evolutionary relationship between vesicle coating complexes and the NPC, and indicates a conserved mechanism by which the NPC is anchored in the nuclear envelope.},
