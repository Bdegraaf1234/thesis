abstract = {In the last two years, because of advances in protein separation and mass spectrometry, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyz-ing complex samples and identifying hundreds and even thousands of proteins. However, computational tools for database search of top-down spectra against protein da-tabases are still in their infancy. We describe MS-Align؉, a fast algorithm for top-down protein identification based on spectral alignment that enables searches for unex-pected post-translational modifications. We also propose a method for evaluating statistical significance of top-down protein identifications and further benchmark vari-ous software tools on two top-down data sets from Sac-charomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium. We demonstrate that MS-Align؉ significantly increases the number of identified spectra as compared with MASCOT and OMSSA on both data sets. Although MS-Align؉ and ProSightPC have similar performance on the Salmonella typhimurium data set, MS-Align؉ outperforms Pro-SightPC on the (more complex) Saccharomyces cerevi-siae data set.

In the past two decades, proteomics was dominated by bottom-up mass spectrometry that analyzes digested pep-tides rather than intact proteins. Bottom-up approaches, al-though powerful, do have limitations in analyzing protein spe-cies, e.g. various proteolytic forms of the same protein or various protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Top-down mass spectrometry focuses on analyzing intact proteins and large peptides (1–10) and has advantages in localizing multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) 1 in a coordinated fashion (e.g. combinatorial PTM code) and identifying multiple protein species (e.g. proteolytically pro-cessed protein species) (11). Until recently, most top-down studies were limited to single purified proteins (12–15). Top-down studies of protein mixtures were restricted by difficulties in separating and fragmenting intact proteins and a shortage of robust computational tools. In the last two years, because of advances in protein sepa-ration and top-down instrumentation, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyzing complex samples containing hundreds and even thousands of proteins (16 –21). Because algorithms for interpreting top-down spectra are still in their infancy, many recent devel-opments include computational innovations in protein identification. Because top-down spectra are complex, the first step in top-down spectral interpretation is usually spectral decon-volution, which converts a complex top-down spectrum to a list of monoisotopic masses (a deconvolved spectrum). Ev-ery protein (possibly with modifications) can be scored against a top-down deconvoluted spectrum, resulting in a Protein-Spectrum-Match (PrSM). The top-down protein identification problem is finding a protein in a database with the highest scoring PrSM for a top-down spectrum and further output the PrSM if it is statistically significant. There are several software tools for top-down protein identifica-tion (Table I). ● ProSightPC—ProSightPC is the most commonly used},

abstract = {Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been routinely used in proteomics studies. Post-translational modification (PTM) identification is a challenging problem in tandem mass spectral analysis. Results: In this paper, we define two scoring functions for identifying peptides/proteins with PTMs from MS/MS spectra: match scores and diagonal scores, as well as two spectral identification problems based on the two scores. We propose several index based algorithms for the two problems. Both theoretical and experimental analyses show that the index based algorithms significantly improve on speed as compared with existing algorithms.},
