abstract = {Protein complexes and protein interaction networks are essential mediators of most biological functions. Complexes supporting transient functions such as signal transduction processes are frequently subject to dynamic remodeling. Currently, the majority of studies on the composition of protein complexes are carried out by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and present a static view of the system. For a better understanding of inherently dynamic biological processes, methods to reliably quantify temporal changes of protein interaction networks are essential. Here we used affinity purification combined with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra (AP-SWATH) mass spectrometry to study the dynamics of the 14-3-3{\$}\beta{\$} scaffold protein interactome after stimulation of the insulin-PI3K-AKT pathway. The consistent and reproducible quantification of 1,967 proteins across all stimulation time points provided insights into the 14-3-3{\$}\beta{\$} interactome and its dynamic changes following IGF1 stimulation. We therefore establish AP-SWATH as a tool to quantify dynamic changes in protein-complex interaction networks.},

abstract = {In the last two years, because of advances in protein separation and mass spectrometry, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyz-ing complex samples and identifying hundreds and even thousands of proteins. However, computational tools for database search of top-down spectra against protein da-tabases are still in their infancy. We describe MS-Align؉, a fast algorithm for top-down protein identification based on spectral alignment that enables searches for unex-pected post-translational modifications. We also propose a method for evaluating statistical significance of top-down protein identifications and further benchmark vari-ous software tools on two top-down data sets from Sac-charomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium. We demonstrate that MS-Align؉ significantly increases the number of identified spectra as compared with MASCOT and OMSSA on both data sets. Although MS-Align؉ and ProSightPC have similar performance on the Salmonella typhimurium data set, MS-Align؉ outperforms Pro-SightPC on the (more complex) Saccharomyces cerevi-siae data set. Molecular {\&} Cellular Proteomics 11: 10.1074/mcp.M111.008524, 1–13, 2012. In the past two decades, proteomics was dominated by bottom-up mass spectrometry that analyzes digested pep-tides rather than intact proteins. Bottom-up approaches, al-though powerful, do have limitations in analyzing protein spe-cies, e.g. various proteolytic forms of the same protein or various protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Top-down mass spectrometry focuses on analyzing intact proteins and large peptides (1–10) and has advantages in localizing multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) 1 in a coordinated fashion (e.g. combinatorial PTM code) and identifying multiple protein species (e.g. proteolytically pro-cessed protein species) (11). Until recently, most top-down studies were limited to single purified proteins (12–15). Top-down studies of protein mixtures were restricted by difficulties in separating and fragmenting intact proteins and a shortage of robust computational tools. In the last two years, because of advances in protein sepa-ration and top-down instrumentation, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyzing complex samples containing hundreds and even thousands of proteins (16 –21). Because algorithms for interpreting top-down spectra are still in their infancy, many recent devel-opments include computational innovations in protein identification. Because top-down spectra are complex, the first step in top-down spectral interpretation is usually spectral decon-volution, which converts a complex top-down spectrum to a list of monoisotopic masses (a deconvolved spectrum). Ev-ery protein (possibly with modifications) can be scored against a top-down deconvoluted spectrum, resulting in a Protein-Spectrum-Match (PrSM). The top-down protein identification problem is finding a protein in a database with the highest scoring PrSM for a top-down spectrum and further output the PrSM if it is statistically significant. There are several software tools for top-down protein identifica-tion (Table I). ● ProSightPC—ProSightPC is the most commonly used},

abstract = {Large-scale protein sequencing methods rely on enzymatic digestion of complex protein mixtures to generate a collection of peptides for mass spectrometric analysis. Here we examine the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, LysC, ArgC, AspN, and GluC) to improve both protein identification and characterization in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1{\%} false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., {\textless}1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.},

abstract = {The coupling of electrospray ionization with Fourier-transform mass spectrometry allows the
analysis of large biomolecules with mass-measuring errors of less than 1 ppm. The large
number of atoms incorporated in these molecules results in a low probability for the
all-monoisotopic species. This produces the potential to misassign the number of heavy
isotopes in a specific peak and make a mass error of f 1 Da, although the certainty of the
measurement beyond the decimal place is greater than 0.1 Da. Statistical tests are used to
compare the measured isotopic distribution with the distribution for a model molecule of the
same average molecular mass, which allows the assignment of the monoisotopic mass, even
in cases where the monoisotopic peak is absent from the spectrum. The statistical test
produces error levels that are inversely proportional to the number of molecules in a
distribution, which allows an estimation of the number of ions in the trapped ion cell. It has
been determined, via this method that 128 charges are required to produce a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3:1, which correlates well with previous experimental methods.},

abstract = {The arrangement of proteins into complexes is a key organizational principle for many cellular functions. Although the topology of many complexes has been systematically analyzed in isolation, their molecular sociology in situ remains elusive. Here, we show that crude cellular extracts of a eukaryotic thermophile, Chaetomium thermophilum, retain basic principles of cellular organization. Using a structural proteomics approach, we simultaneously characterized the abundance, interactions, and structure of a third of the C. thermophilum proteome within these extracts. We identified 27 distinct protein communities that include 108 interconnected complexes, which dynamically associate with each other and functionally benefit from being in close proximity in the cell. Furthermore, we investigated the structure of fatty acid synthase within these extracts by cryoEM and this revealed multiple, flexible states of the enzyme in adaptation to its association with other complexes, thus exemplifying the need for in situ studies. As the components of the captured protein communities are known-at both the protein and complex levels-this study constitutes another step forward toward a molecular understanding of subcellular organization. {\textcopyright}2017 European Molecular Biology Laboratory.

abstract = {Simple and efficient digestion of proteins, particularly hydrophobic membrane proteins, is of significance for comprehensive proteome analysis using the bottom-up approach. We report a microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis (MAAH) method for rapid protein degradation for peptide mass mapping and tandem mass spectrometric analysis of peptides for protein identification. It uses 25{\%} trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) aqueous solution to dissolve or suspend proteins, followed by microwave irradiation for 10 min. This detergent-free method generates peptide mixtures that can be directly analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) without the need of extensive sample cleanup. LC-MALDI MS/MS analysis of the hydrolysate from 5 g of a model transmembrane protein, bacteriorho-dopsin, resulted in almost complete sequence coverage by the peptides detected, including the identification of two posttranslational modification sites. Cleavage of peptide bonds inside all seven transmembrane domains took place, generating peptides of sizes amenable to MS/MS to determine possible sequence errors or modifications within these domains. Cleavage specificity, such as glycine residue cleavage, was observed. Terminal peptides were found to be present in relatively high abundance in the hydrolysate, particularly when low concentrations of proteins were used for MAAH. It was shown that these peptides could still be detected from MAAH of bacteriorhodopsin at a protein concentration of 1 ng/l or 37 fmol/l. To evaluate the general applicability of this method, it was applied to identify proteins from a membrane protein enriched fraction of cell lysates of human breast cancer cell line MCF7. With one-dimensional LC-MALDI MS/MS, a total of 119 proteins, including 41 membrane-associated or membrane proteins containing one to 12 transmembrane domains, were identified by MS/MS database searching based on matches of at least two peptides to a protein.

abstract = {The primary utility of trypsin digestion in proteomics is that it cleaves proteins at predictable locations, but it is also notable for yielding peptides that terminate in basic arginine and lysine residues. Tryptic peptides fragment in ion trap tandem mass spectrometry to produce prominent C-terminal y series ions. Alternative proteolytic digests may produce peptides that do not follow these rules. In this study, we examine 2568 peptides generated through proteinase K digestion, a technique that produces a greater diversity of basic residue content in peptides. We show that the position of basic residues within peptides influences the peak intensities of b and y series ions; a basic residue near the N-terminus of a peptide can lead to prominent b series peaks rather than the intense y series peaks associated with tryptic peptides. The effects of presence and position for arginine, lysine, and histidine are explored separately and in combination. Arg shows the most dominant effects followed by His and then by Lys. Fragment ions containing basic residues produce more intense peaks than those without basic residues. Doubly charged precursor ions have generally been modeled as producing only singly charged fragment ions, but fragment ions that contain two basic residues may accept both protons during fragmentation. By characterizing the influence of basic residues on gas-phase fragmentation of peptides, this research makes possible more accurate fragmentation models for peptide identification algorithms. Trypsin digestion is a standard step in many proteomic experiments. Proteins digested by this enzyme are predominantly cleaved C-terminal to arginine and lysine residues, yielding predictable collections of peptides.1 Tryptic peptides are particularly favored for tandem mass spectrometry because they yield spectra with prominent y series ions. Database search algorithms such as SEQUEST 2 have been tuned to work best with tryptic peptides. Alternative digestion techniques can be useful to analyze proteins that do not have many suitable cleavage sites for trypsin (such as membrane proteins) or to increase the diversity of peptides covering a protein region of interest. The cleavage specificities of other digestion enzymes may yield peptides that fragment differently than those produced by trypsin. One technique showing promise for proteomics is proteinase K digestion. 3 Proteinase K's specificity is more variable than trypsin, favoring amino acids with aromatic side chains as cleavage sites but targeting other residues as well. 4 The digestion time required is less than},

@article{Maiolica2014,
abstract = {Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of Haspin kinase activity for the correct positioning of the kinase Aurora B at the centromere. Haspin phosphorylates Thr3 of the histone H3 (H3), which provides a signal for Aurora B to localize to the centromere of mitotic chromosomes. To date, histone H3 is the only confirmed Haspin substrate. We used a combination of biochemical, pharmacological, and mass spectrometric approaches to study the consequences of Haspin inhibition in mitotic cells. We quantified 3964 phosphorylation sites on chromatin-associated proteins and identified a Haspin protein-protein interaction network. We determined the Haspin consensus motif and the co-crystal structure of the kinase with the histone H3 tail. The structure revealed a unique bent substrate binding mode positioning the histone H3 residues Arg2 and Lys4 adjacent to the Haspin phosphorylated threonine into acidic binding pockets. This unique conformation of the kinase-substrate complex explains the reported modulation of Haspin activity by methylation of Lys4 of the histone H3. In addition, the identification of the structural basis of substrate recognition and the amino acid sequence preferences of Haspin aided the identification of novel candidate Haspin substrates. In particular, we validated the phosphorylation of Ser137 of the histone variant macroH2A as a target of Haspin kinase activity. MacroH2A Ser137 resides in a basic stretch of about 40 amino acids that is required to stabilize extranucleosomal DNA, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser137 might regulate the interactions of macroH2A and DNA. Overall, our data suggest that Haspin activity affects the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in gene expression regulation and splicing.},

@article{Perkins1999,
abstract = {Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

@article{Horn2000,
abstract = {Here a fully automated computer algorithm is applied to complex mass spectra of peptides and proteins. This method uses a subtractive peak finding routine to locate possible isotopic clusters in the spectrum, subjecting these to a combination of the previous Fourier transform/Patterson method for primary charge determination and the method for least-squares fitting to a theoretically derived isotopic abundance distribution for m/z determination of the most abundant isotopic peak, and the statistical reliability of this determination. If a predicted protein sequence is available, each such m/z value is checked for assignment as a sequence fragment. A new signal-to-noise calculation procedure has been devised for accurate determination of baseline and noise width for spectra with high peak density. In 2 h, the program identified 824 isotopic clusters representing 581 mass values in the spectrum of a GluC digest of a 191 kDa protein; this is {\textgreater}50{\%} more than the number of mass values found by the extremely tedious operator-applied methodology used previously. The program should be generally applicable to classes of large molecules, including DNA and polymers. Thorough high resolution analysis of spectra by Horn (THRASH) is proposed as the program's verb.

Post-translational modification (PTM) identification is a challenging problem in tandem mass spectral analysis. Results: In this paper, we define two scoring functions for identifying peptides/proteins with PTMs from MS/MS spectra: match scores and diagonal scores, as well as two spectral identification problems based on the two scores. We propose several index based algorithms for the two problems. Both theoretical and experimental analyses show that the index based algorithms significantly improve on speed as compared with existing algorithms.},
