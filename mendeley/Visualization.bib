abstract = {Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction withlarge databases of protein–protein, protein–DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a searchfor interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of many possible types of graph visualization, and also detailed descriptions of the most popular algorithms. Its primal goal is, to help a user, with some relational data on his hands and a need to visualizing it, with the choice of what to use, and what is out there that can be used. However, it can be also viewed as historical overview of graph drawing algorithms, and its evolution.},
