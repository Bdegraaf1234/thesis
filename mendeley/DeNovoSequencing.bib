abstract = {The Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (www.topdownproteomics.org) launched the present study to assess the current state of top-down mass spectrometry (TD MS) and middle-down mass spectrometry (MD MS) for characterizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) primary structures, including their modifications. To meet the needs of the rapidly growing therapeutic antibody market, it is important to develop analytical strategies to characterize the heterogeneity of a therapeutic product's primary structure accurately and reproducibly. The major objective of the present study is to determine whether current TD/MD MS technologies and protocols can add value to the more commonly employed bottom-up (BU) approaches with regard to confirming protein integrity, sequencing variable domains, avoiding artifacts, and revealing modifications and their locations. We also aim to gather information on the common TD/MD MS methods and practices in the field. A panel of three mAbs was selected and centrally provided to 20 laboratories worldwide for the analysis: Sigma mAb standard (SiLuLite), NIST mAb standard, and the therapeutic mAb Herceptin (trastuzumab). Various MS instrument platforms and ion dissociation techniques were employed. The present study confirms that TD/MD MS tools are available in laboratories worldwide and provide complementary information to the BU approach that can be crucial for comprehensive mAb characterization. The current limitations, as well as possible solutions to overcome them, are also outlined. A primary limitation revealed by the results of the present study is that the expert knowledge in both experiment and data analysis is indispensable to practice TD/MD MS.},

abstract = {We report the isolation of two human IgG1k monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These mAbs were isolated from two donors who had recovered from COVID-19 infection during the first pandemic peak in the Lombardy region of Italy, the first European and initially most affected region in March 2020. We used the method of EBV immortalization of purified memory B cells and supernatant screening with a spike S1/2 assay for mAb isolation. This method allowed rapid isolation of clones, with one donor showing about 7{\%} of clones positive against spike protein, whereas the other donor did not produce positive clones out of 91 tested. RNA was extracted from positive clones 39â€“47 days post-EBV infection, allowing VH and VL sequencing. The same clones were sequenced again after a further 100 days in culture, showing that no mutation had taken place during in vitro expansion. The B cell clones could be expanded in culture for more than 4 months after EBV immortalization and secreted the antibodies stably during that time, allowing to purify mg quantities of each mAb for functional assays without generating recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, neither mAb had significant neutralizing activity in a virus infection assay with several different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The antibody sequences are made freely available.},

abstract = {Onco-proteogenomics aims to understand how changes in a cancer's genome influences its proteome. One challenge in integrating these molecular data is the identification of aberrant protein products from mass-spectrometry (MS) datasets, as traditional proteomic analyses only identify proteins from a reference sequence database. We established proteomic workflows to detect peptide variants within MS datasets. We used a combination of publicly available population variants (dbSNP and UniProt) and somatic variations in cancer (COSMIC) along with sample-specific genomic and transcriptomic data to examine proteome variation within and across 59 cancer cell-lines. We developed a set of recommendations for the detection of variants using three search algorithms, a split target-decoy approach for FDR estimation, and multiple post-search filters. We examined 7.3 million unique variant tryptic peptides not found within any reference proteome and identified 4771 mutations corresponding to somatic and germline deviations from reference proteomes in 2200 genes among the NCI60 cell-line proteomes. We discuss in detail the technical and computational challenges in identifying variant peptides by MS and show that uncovering these variants allows the identification of druggable mutations within important cancer genes.},

abstract = {In this 12th annual installment of the Antibodies to Watch article series, we discuss key events in antibody therapeutics development that occurred in 2020 and forecast events that might occur in 2021. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed an array of challenges and opportunities to the healthcare system in 2020, and it will continue to do so in 2021. Remarkably, by late November 2020, two anti-SARS-CoV antibody products, bamlanivimab and the casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail, were authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the repurposed antibodies levilimab and itolizumab had been registered for emergency use as treatments for COVID-19 in Russia and India, respectively. Despite the pandemic, 10 antibody therapeutics had been granted the first approval in the US or EU in 2020, as of November, and 2 more (tanezumab and margetuximab) may be granted approvals in December 2020.* In addition, prolgolimab and olokizumab had been granted first approvals in Russia and cetuximab saratolacan sodium was first approved in Japan. The number of approvals in 2021 may set a record, as marketing applications for 16 investigational antibody therapeutics are already undergoing regulatory review by either the FDA or the European Medicines Agency. Of these 16 mAbs, 11 are possible treatments for non-cancer indications and 5 are potential treatments for cancer. Based on the information publicly available as of November 2020, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for non-cancer indications, including 6 for COVID-19, and marketing applications for at least 6 (leronlimab, tezepelumab, faricimab, ligelizumab, garetosmab, and fasinumab) are planned in 2021. In addition, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for cancer indications. Of these 44, marketing application submissions for 13 may be submitted by the end of 2021. *Note added in proof on key events announced during December 1-21, 2020: margetuximab-cmkb and ansuvimab-zykl were approved by FDA on December 16 and 21, 2020, respectively; biologics license applications were submitted for ublituximab and amivantamab.},

@article{Castellana2010a,
abstract = {Database search algorithms are the primary workhorses for the identification of tandem mass spectra. However, these methods are limited to the identification of spectra for which peptides are present in the database, preventing the identification of peptides from mutated or alternatively spliced sequences. A variety of methods has been developed to search a spectrum against a sequence allowing for variations. Some tools determine the sequence of the homologous protein in the related species but do not report the peptide in the target organism. Other tools consider variations, including modifications and mutations , in reconstructing the target sequence. However, these tools will not work if the template (homologous peptide) is missing in the database, and they do not attempt to reconstruct the entire protein target sequence. De novo identification of peptide sequences is another possibility, because it does not require a protein database. However, the lack of database reduces the accuracy. We present a novel proteogenomic approach, GenoMS, that draws on the strengths of database and de novo peptide identification methods. Protein sequence templates (i.e. proteins or genomic sequences that are similar to the target protein) are identified using the database search tool InsPecT. The templates are then used to recruit, align, and de novo sequence regions of the target protein that have diverged from the database or are missing. We used GenoMS to reconstruct the full sequence of an antibody by using spectra acquired from multiple digests using different proteases. Antibodies are a prime example of proteins that confound standard database identification techniques. The mature antibody genes result from large-scale genome rearrangements with flexible fusion boundaries and somatic hypermutation. Using GenoMS we automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of two immunoglobulin chains with accuracy greater than 98{\%} using a diverged protein database. Using the genome as the template, we achieve accuracy exceeding 97{\%}.},

abstract = {From a molecular perspective, enactors of function in biology are intact proteins that can be variably modified at the genetic, transcriptional, or post-translational level. Over the past 30 years, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful method for the analysis of proteomes. Prevailing bottom-up proteomics operates at the level of the peptide, leading to issues with protein inference, connectivity, and incomplete sequence/modification information. Top-down proteomics (TDP), alternatively, applies MS at the proteoform level to analyze intact proteins with diverse sources of intramolecular complexity preserved during analysis. Fortunately, advances in prefractionation workflows, MS instrumentation, and dissociation methods for whole-protein ions have helped TDP emerge as an accessible and potentially disruptive modality with increasingly translational value. In this review, we discuss technical and conceptual advances in TDP, along with the growing power of proteoform-resolved measurements in clinical and translational research.},

abstract = {Over the past twenty years diverse groups in Northeast Asia, Western Europe, and North America have competed to map, sequence, and characterize the immunoglobulin loci of mouse and man. Now that this work is near completion, it has become evident that the human and mouse germline repertoires share broad similarities in gene composition, organization, and other general principles. In spite of these similarities, the repertoires expressed by adult mice and humans are distinct and differ from each other in detail. In both species the mechanisms used to create repertoire diversity appear designed to generate a random range of antigen binding sites. However, a detailed analysis reveals significant constraints in the sequence and amino acid composition of the third complementarity region of the H chain (CDR-H3), which lies at the center of the antigen binding site. The mechanisms used to regulate the composition of the repertoire, their significance to the development and maintenance of immune competence, and the contribution of violation of normal repertoire boundaries to the development of diseases of immune function remain foci of ongoing investigation.},

The proteome is extremely multifaceted owing to splicing and protein modifications, and this is further amplified by the interconnectivity of proteins into complexes and signalling networks that are highly divergent in time and space. Proteome analysis heavily relies on mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based proteomics is starting to mature and to deliver through a combination of developments in instrumentation, sample preparation and computational analysis.

abstract = {Immunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of 2 heavy and 2 light chains. They can be separated functionally into variable domains that bind antigens and constant domains that specify effector functions, such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors. The variable domains are created by means of a complex series of gene rearrangement events and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutation after exposure to antigen to allow affinity maturation. Each variable domain can be split into 3 regions of sequence variability termed the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and 4 regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions. The 3 CDRs of the heavy chain are paired with the 3 CDRs of the light chain to form the antigen-binding site, as classically defined. The constant domains of the heavy chain can be switched to allow altered effector function while maintaining antigen specificity. There are 5 main classes of heavy chain constant domains. Each class defines the IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE isotypes. IgG can be split into 4 subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, each with its own biologic properties, and IgA can similarly be split into IgA1 and IgA2.},

abstract = {Antibody sequence information is crucial to understanding the structural basis for antigen binding and enables the use of antibodies as therapeutics and research tools. Here, we demonstrate a method for direct de novo sequencing of monoclonal IgG from the purified antibody products. The method uses a panel of multiple complementary proteases to generate suitable peptides for de novo sequencing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a bottom-up fashion. Furthermore, we apply a dual fragmentation scheme, using both stepped high-energy collision dissociation (stepped HCD) and electron-transfer high-energy collision dissociation (EThcD), on all peptide precursors. The method achieves full sequence coverage of the monoclonal antibody herceptin, with an accuracy of 99{\%} in the variable regions. We applied the method to sequence the widely used anti-FLAG-M2 mouse monoclonal antibody, which we successfully validated by remodeling a high-resolution crystal structure of the Fab and demonstrating binding to a FLAG-tagged target protein in Western blot analysis. The method thus offers robust and reliable sequences of monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Protein interactions enable much more complex behavior than the sum of the individual protein parts would suggest and represents a level of biological complexity requiring full understanding when unravelling cellular processes. Cross-linking mass spectrometry has emerged as an attractive approach to study these interactions, and recent advances in mass spectrometry and data analysis software have enabled the identification of thousands of cross-links from a single experiment. The resulting data complexity is, however, difficult to understand and requires interactive software tools. Even though solutions are available, these represent an agglomerate of possibilities, and each features its own input format, often forcing manual conversion. Here we present Cross-ID, a visualization platform that links directly into the output of XlinkX for Proteome Discoverer but also plays well with other platforms by supporting a user-controllable text-file importer. The platform includes features like grouping, spectral viewer, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, post-translational modification (PTM) visualization, domains and secondary structure mapping, data set comparison, previsualization overlap check, and more. Validation of detected cross-links is available for proteins and complexes with known structure or for protein complexes through the DisVis online platform (http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/DISVIS/disvis/). Graphs are exportable in PDF format, and data sets can be exported in tab-separated text files for evaluation through other software.},

There is no licensed treatment or vaccine against the virus, underscoring the need for efficacious countermeasures. We ascertained that a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit Ebola virus disease outbreak maintained circulating antibodies against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein for more than a decade after infection. From this survivor we isolated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize recent and previous outbreak variants of Ebola virus and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Strikingly, monotherapy with mAb114 protected macaques when given as late as 5 days after challenge. Treatment with a single human mAb suggests that a simplified therapeutic strategy for human Ebola infection may be possible.},

abstract = {Recently, a mass spectrometry-based approach was introduced to directly assess the IgG1 immunoglobulin clonal repertoires in plasma. Here we expanded upon this approach by describing a mass spectrometry-based technique to assess specifically the clonal repertoire of another important class of immunoglobulin molecules, IgA1, and show it is efficiently and robustly applicable to either milk or plasma samples. Focusing on two individual healthy donors, whose milk was sampled longitudinally during the first 16 weeks of lactation, we demonstrate that the total repertoire of milk sIgA1 is dominated by only 50-500 clones, even though the human body theoretically can generate several orders of magnitude more clones. We show that in each donor the sIgA1 repertoire only changes marginally and quite gradually over the monitored 16-week period of lactation. Furthermore, the observed overlap in clonal repertoires between the two individual donors is close to non-existent. Mothers provide protection to their newborn infants directly by the transfer of antibodies via breastfeeding. The approach introduced here, can be used to visualize the clonal repertoire transferred from mother to infant and to detect changes in-time in that repertoire adapting to changes in maternal physiology.},

abstract = {Antibodies can target a vast molecular diversity of antigens. This is achieved by generating a complementary diversity of antibody sequences through somatic recombination and hypermutation. A full understanding of the antibody repertoire in health and disease therefore requires dedicated de novo sequencing methods. Next-generation cDNA sequencing methods have laid the foundation of our current understanding of the antibody repertoire, but these methods share one major limitation in that they target the antibody-producing B-cells, rather than the functional secreted product in bodily fluids. Mass spectrometry-based methods offer an opportunity to bridge this gap between antibody repertoire profiling and bulk serological assays, as they can access antibody sequence information straight from the secreted polypeptide products. In a step to meeting the challenge of mass spectrometry (MS)-based antibody sequencing, we present a fast and simple software tool (Stitch) to map proteomic short reads to user-defined templates with dedicated features for both monoclonal antibody sequencing and profiling of polyclonal antibody repertoires. We demonstrate the use of Stitch by fully reconstructing two monoclonal antibody sequences with {\textgreater}98{\%} accuracy (including I/L assignment); sequencing a Fab from patient serum isolated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) fractionation against a high background of homologous antibody sequences; sequencing antibody light chains from the urine of multiple-myeloma patients; and profiling the IgG repertoire in sera from patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We demonstrate that Stitch assembles a comprehensive overview of the antibody sequences that are represented in the dataset and provides an important first step toward analyzing polyclonal antibodies and repertoire profiling.},

Here, we combined several mass-spectrometry-based approaches to reveal that the circulating IgG1 repertoire in human plasma is dominated by a limited number of clones in healthy donors and septic patients. We observe that each individual donor exhibits a unique serological IgG1 repertoire, which remains stable over time but can adapt rapidly to changes in physiology. We introduce an integrative protein- and peptide-centric approach to obtain and validate a full sequence of an individual plasma IgG1 clone de novo. This IgG1 clone emerged at the onset of a septic episode and exhibited a high mutation rate (13{\%}) compared with the closest matching germline DNA sequence, highlighting the importance of de novo sequencing at the protein level.

abstract = {In multiple myeloma diseases, monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) are abundantly produced, with, as a consequence in some cases, the formation of deposits affecting various organs, such as the kidney, while in other cases remaining soluble up to concentrations of several g{\textperiodcentered}L-1 in plasma. The exact factors crucial for the solubility of LCs are poorly understood, but it can be hypothesized that their amino acid sequence plays an important role. Determining the precise sequences of patient-derived LCs is therefore highly desirable. We establish here a novel de novo sequencing workflow for patient-derived LCs, based on the combination of bottom-up and top-down proteomics without database search. PEAKS is used for the de novo sequencing of peptides that are further assembled into full length LC sequences using ALPS. Top-down proteomics provides the molecular masses of proteoforms and allows the exact determination of the amino acid sequence including all posttranslational modifications. This pipeline is then used for the complete de novo sequencing of LCs extracted from the urine of 10 patients with multiple myeloma. We show that for the bottom-up part, digestions with trypsin and Nepenthes digestive fluid are sufficient to produce overlapping peptides able to generate the best sequence candidates. Top-down proteomics is absolutely required to achieve 100{\%} final sequence coverage and characterize clinical samples containing several LCs. Our work highlights an unexpected range of modifications.},

abstract = {In principle, humans can produce an antibody response to any non-self-antigen molecule in the appropriate context. This flexibility is achieved by the presence of a large repertoire of naive antibodies, the diversity of which is expanded by somatic hypermutation following antigen exposure1. The diversity of the naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least 1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 Ã— 109, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires have been prohibitively difficult, primarily owing to their massive size. The amount of information encoded by all of the rearranged antibody and T cell receptor genes in one person-the 'genome' of the adaptive immune system-exceeds the size of the human genome by more than four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because much of the B lymphocyte population is localized in organs or tissues that cannot be comprehensively sampled from living subjects, human repertoire studies have focused on circulating B cells3. Here we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present what is, to our knowledge, the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy-chain sequences. This dataset enables genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at an unprecedented depth and granularity, which reveals largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and an exceptional overall diversity of the antibody repertoire.},

abstract = {Background: IdeS, a proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes, cleaves Immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies with a unique degree of specificity. Pathogenic IgG antibodies constitute an important clinical problem contributing to the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune conditions and acute transplant rejection. To be able to effectively remove such antibodies is therefore an important clinical challenge. Methodology/Principal Findings: IdeS was found to specifically and efficiently cleave IgG in human blood in vitro (20 $\mu$g of IdeS caused a complete degradation of IgG in one ml of human whole blood in 15 minutes) and to clear IgG from the blood stream of rabbits in vivo (no IgG was detected six hours following an intravenous injection of 5 mg of IdeS) without any side effects. In a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), polyclonal IgG antibodies against platelet surface antigens were used to induce a lethal disease. These profoundly thrombocytopenic animals were treated and cured by a single injection of IdeS. Conclusions/Significance: Novel information is provided concerning the IgG-cleaving activity of IdeS in vitro and in vivo. The highly specific and rapid elimination of IgG in vivo, the dramatic effect in a mouse model of ITP, and the lack of side effects in the treated animals, indicate that IdeS could also be used to treat IgG-driven diseases in humans.

For the first time, the immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody and T cell receptor (TR) genes were officially recognized as â€˜genes' as well as were conventional genes. This major breakthrough has allowed the entry, in genomic databases, of the IG and TR variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes and alleles of Homo sapiens and of other jawed vertebrate species, based on the CLASSIFICATION axiom. The second major breakthrough has been the IMGT unique numbering and the IMGT Collier de Perles for the V and constant (C) domains of the IG and TR and other proteins of the IG superfamily (IgSF), based on the NUMEROTATION axiom. IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts bridge genes, sequences, structures and functions, between biological and computational spheres in the IMGT{\textregistered} system (Web resources, databases and tools). They provide the IMGT Scientific chart rules to identify, to describe and to analyse the IG complex molecular data, the huge diversity of repertoires, the genetic (alleles, allotypes, CNV) polymorphisms, the IG dual function (paratope/epitope, effector properties), the antibody humanization and engineering.},

abstract = {Repertoire sequencing of B cells is the high-throughput profiling of B cell receptors (BCR) expressed on the surface of B cells and of immunoglobulins (Ig) expressed by antibody secreting cells. Each BCR/Ig transcript has a unique complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequence that can be used to identify and track individual B cell lymphocytes over time and throughout different compartments of the human body. B cell differentiation can be further tracked by assessing the point mutations acquired during affinity maturation via somatic hypermutation (SHM). Here we describe a method for high-throughput sequencing of the variable region of Ig heavy-chain transcripts for repertoire analysis of human B cells on the Illumina Miseq platform.},

@article{Tran2016,
abstract = {De novo protein sequencing is one of the key problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, especially for novel proteins such as monoclonal antibodies for which genome information is often limited or not available. However, due to limitations in peptides fragmentation and coverage, as well as ambiguities in spectra interpretation, complete de novo assembly of unknown protein sequences still remains challenging. To address this problem, we propose an integrated system, ALPS, which for the first time can automatically assemble full-length monoclonal antibody sequences. Our system integrates de novo sequencing peptides, their quality scores and error-correction information from databases into a weighted de Bruijn graph to assemble protein sequences. We evaluated ALPS performance on two antibody data sets, each including a heavy chain and a light chain. The results show that ALPS was able to assemble three complete monoclonal antibody sequences of length 216-441 AA, at 100{\%} coverage, and 96.64-100{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {The international ImMunoGeneTics database{\textregistered} (IMGT) (http://imgt.cines.fr), is a high quality integrated information system specializing in Immunoglobulins (IG), T cell Receptors (TR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, created in 1989, by the Laboratoire d'ImmunoG{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tique Mol{\'{e}}culaire (LIGM), at the Universit{\'{e}} Montpellier II, CNRS, Montpellier, France. IMGT provides a common access to standardized data which include nucleotide and protein sequences, oligonucleotide primers, gene maps, genetic polymorphisms, specificities, 2D and 3D structures. IMGT includes three sequence databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/MHC-DB, IMGT/PRIMER-DB), one genome database (IMGT/GENE-DB) with different interfaces (IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/GeneView, IMGT/LocusView), one 3D structure database (IMGT/3Dstructure-DB), Web resources comprising 8000 HTML pages ('IMGT Marie-Paule page') and interactive tools for sequence analysis (IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, IMGT/Allele-Align, IMGT/PhyloGene). IMGT data are expertly annotated according to the rules of the IMGT Scientific chart, based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. IMGT tools are particularly useful for the analysis of the IG and TR repertoires in physiological normal and pathological situations. IMGT has important applications in medical research (autoimmune diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), biotechnology related to antibody engineering (phage displays, combinatorial libraries) and therapeutic approaches (graft, immunotherapy). IMGT is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fr.},

abstract = {Antibodies are vital proteins of the immune system that recognize potentially harmful molecules and initiate their removal. Mammals can efficiently create vast numbers of antibodies with different sequences capable of binding to any antigen with high affinity and specificity. Because they can be developed to bind to many disease agents, antibodies can be used as therapeutics. In an organism, after antigen exposure, antibodies specific to that antigen are enriched through clonal selection, expansion, and somatic hypermutation. The antibodies present in an organism therefore report on its immune status, describe its innate ability to deal with harmful substances, and reveal how it has previously responded. Next-generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used to query the antibody, or B-cell receptor (BCR), sequence repertoire, and the amount of BCR data in public repositories is growing. The Observed Antibody Space database, for example, currently contains over a billion sequences from 68 different studies. Repertoires are available that represent both the naive state (i.e. antigen-inexperienced) and that after immunization. This wealth of data has created opportunities to learn more about our immune system. In this review, we discuss the many ways in which BCR repertoire data have been or could be exploited. We highlight its utility for providing insights into how the naive immune repertoire is generated and how it responds to antigens. We also consider how structural information can be used to enhance these data and may lead to more accurate depictions of the sequence space and to applications in the discovery of new therapeutics.},

abstract = {A key step in therapeutic and endogenous humoral antibody characterization is identifying the amino acid sequence. So far, this task has been mainly tackled through sequencing of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires at the nucleotide level. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as an alternative tool for obtaining sequence information directly at theâ€“most relevantâ€“protein level. Although several MS methods are now well established, analysis of recombinant and endogenous antibodies comes with a specific set of challenges, requiring approaches beyond the conventional proteomics workflows. Here, we review the challenges in MS-based sequencing of both recombinant as well as endogenous humoral antibodies and outline state-of-the-art methods attempting to overcome these obstacles. We highlight recent examples and discuss remaining challenges. We foresee a great future for these approaches making de novo antibody sequencing and discovery by MS-based techniques feasible, even for complex clinical samples from endogenous sources such as serum and other liquid biopsies.},
