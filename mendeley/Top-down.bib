abstract = {In the last two years, because of advances in protein separation and mass spectrometry, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyz-ing complex samples and identifying hundreds and even thousands of proteins. However, computational tools for database search of top-down spectra against protein da-tabases are still in their infancy. We describe MS-Align؉, a fast algorithm for top-down protein identification based on spectral alignment that enables searches for unex-pected post-translational modifications. We also propose a method for evaluating statistical significance of top-down protein identifications and further benchmark vari-ous software tools on two top-down data sets from Sac-charomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium. We demonstrate that MS-Align؉ significantly increases the number of identified spectra as compared with MASCOT and OMSSA on both data sets. Although MS-Align؉ and ProSightPC have similar performance on the Salmonella typhimurium data set, MS-Align؉ outperforms Pro-SightPC on the (more complex) Saccharomyces cerevi-siae data set. Molecular {\&} Cellular Proteomics 11: 10.1074/mcp.M111.008524, 1–13, 2012. In the past two decades, proteomics was dominated by bottom-up mass spectrometry that analyzes digested pep-tides rather than intact proteins. Bottom-up approaches, al-though powerful, do have limitations in analyzing protein spe-cies, e.g. various proteolytic forms of the same protein or various protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Top-down mass spectrometry focuses on analyzing intact proteins and large peptides (1–10) and has advantages in localizing multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) 1 in a coordinated fashion (e.g. combinatorial PTM code) and identifying multiple protein species (e.g. proteolytically pro-cessed protein species) (11). Until recently, most top-down studies were limited to single purified proteins (12–15). Top-down studies of protein mixtures were restricted by difficulties in separating and fragmenting intact proteins and a shortage of robust computational tools. In the last two years, because of advances in protein sepa-ration and top-down instrumentation, top-down mass spec-trometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyzing complex samples containing hundreds and even thousands of proteins (16 –21). Because algorithms for interpreting top-down spectra are still in their infancy, many recent devel-opments include computational innovations in protein identification. Because top-down spectra are complex, the first step in top-down spectral interpretation is usually spectral decon-volution, which converts a complex top-down spectrum to a list of monoisotopic masses (a deconvolved spectrum). Ev-ery protein (possibly with modifications) can be scored against a top-down deconvoluted spectrum, resulting in a Protein-Spectrum-Match (PrSM). The top-down protein identification problem is finding a protein in a database with the highest scoring PrSM for a top-down spectrum and further output the PrSM if it is statistically significant. There are several software tools for top-down protein identifica-tion (Table I). ● ProSightPC—ProSightPC is the most commonly used},

abstract = {Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a medical emergency and can represent a life-threatening complication for hematology patients treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens. In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a "real world" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9{\%}, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6{\%} in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4{\%} vs 7.5{\%}) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5{\%} of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population.},

abstract = {Separation of proteoforms for global intact protein analysis (i.e. top-down proteomics) has lagged well behind what is achievable for peptides in traditional bottom-up proteomic approach and is becoming a true bottle neck for top-down proteomics. Herein, we report use of long (≥1M) columns containing short alkyl (C1-C4) bonded phases to achieve high-resolution RPLC for separation of proteoforms. At a specific operation pressure limit (i.e., 96.5MPa or 14Kpsi used in this work), column length was found to be the most important factor for achieving maximal resolution separation of proteins when 1.5–5{\$}\mu{\$}m particles were used as packings and long columns provided peak capacities greater than 400 for proteoforms derived from a global cell lysate with molecular weights below 50kDa. Larger proteoforms (50–110kDa) were chromatographed on long RPLC columns and detected by MS; however, they cannot be identified yet by tandem mass spectrometry. Our experimental data further demonstrated that long alkyl (e.g., C8 and C18) bonded particles provided high-resolution RPLC for {\textless}10kDa proteoforms, not efficient for separation of global proteoforms. Reversed-phase particles with porous, nonporous, and superficially porous surfaces were systematically investigated for high-resolution RPLC. Pore size (200–400{\AA}) and the surface structure (porous and superficially porous) of particles was found to have minor influences on high-resolution RPLC of proteoforms. RPLC presented herein enabled confident identification of ∼900 proteoforms (1{\%} FDR) for a low-microgram quantity of proteomic samples using a single RPLC–MS/MS analysis. The level of RPLC performance attained in this work is close to that typically realized in bottom-up proteomics, and broadly useful when applying e.g., the single-stage MS accurate mass tag approach, but less effective when combined with current tandem MS. Our initial data indicate that MS detection and fragmentation inefficiencies provided by current high-resolution mass spectrometers are key challenges for characterization of larger proteoforms.},

abstract = {Various proteoforms may be generated from a single gene due to primary structure alterations (PSAs) such as genetic variations, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Top-down mass spectrometry is capable of analyzing intact proteins and identifying patterns of multiple PSAs, making it the method of choice for studying complex proteoforms. In top-down proteomics, proteoform identification is often performed by searching tandem mass spectra against a protein sequence database that contains only one reference protein sequence for each gene or transcript variant in a proteome. Because of the incompleteness of the protein database, an identified proteoform may contain unknown PSAs compared with the reference sequence. Proteoform characterization is to identify and localize PSAs in a proteoform. Although many software tools have been proposed for proteoform identification by top-down mass spectrometry, the characterization of proteoforms in identified proteoform−spectrum matches still relies mainly on manual annotation. We propose to use the Modification Identification Score (MIScore), which is based on Bayesian models, to automatically identify and localize PTMs in proteoforms. Experiments showed that the MIScore is accurate in identifying and localizing one or two modifications.},

abstract = {The regulatory bodies request full sequence data assessment both for innovator and biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Full sequence coverage is typically used to verify the integrity of the analytical data obtained following the combination of multiple LC-MS/MS datasets from orthogonal protease digests (so called "bottom-up" approaches). Top-down or middle-down mass spectrometric approaches have the potential to minimize artifacts, reduce overall analysis time and provide orthogonality to this traditional approach. In this work we report a new combined approach involving middle-up LC-QTOF and middle-down LC-MALDI in-source decay (ISD) mass spectrometry. This was applied to cetuximab, panitumumab and natalizumab, selected as representative US Food and Drug Administration-and European Medicines Agency-approved mAbs. The goal was to unambiguously confirm their reference sequences and examine the general applicability of this approach. Furthermore, a new measure for assessing the integrity and validity of results from middle-down approaches is introduced-the "Sequence Validation Percentage." Full sequence data assessment of the 3 antibodies was achieved enabling all 3 sequences to be fully validated by a combination of middle-up molecular weight determination and middle-down protein sequencing. Three errors in the reference amino acid sequence of natalizumab, causing a cumulative mass shift of only ¡2 Da in the natalizumab Fd domain, were corrected as a result of this work.},

abstract = {Top-down proteomics studies intact proteins, enabling new opportunities for analyzing post-translational modi-fications. Because tandem mass spectra of intact pro-teins are very complex, spectral deconvolution (grouping peaks into isotopomer envelopes) is a key initial stage for their interpretation. In such spectra, isotopomer enve-lopes of different protein fragments span overlapping re-gions on the m/z axis and even share spectral peaks. This raises both pattern recognition and combinatorial challenges for spectral deconvolution. We present MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm for spectral deconvolu-tion. The algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer envelopes for a spectrum, then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally selects its highest scor-ing subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the graph. In contrast with other approaches, the algorithm scores sets of envelopes rather than individual envelopes. We demonstrate that MS-Deconv improves on Thrash and Xtract in the number of correctly recovered monoisotopic masses and speed. We applied MS-Deconv to a large set of top-down spectra from Yersinia rohdei (with a still unsequenced genome) and further matched them against the protein database of related and sequenced bacte-rium Yersinia enterocolitica. MS-Deconv is available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software.html. Molecular {\&} Cellular Proteomics 9:2772–2782, 2010. Top-down proteomics is a mass spectrometry-based ap-proach for identification of proteins and their post-transla-tional modifications (PTMs) 1 (1–14). Unlike the " bottom-up " approach where proteins are first digested into peptides and then a peptide mixture is analyzed by mass spectrometry, the top-down approach analyzes intact proteins. Thus, it has advantages in detecting and localizing PTMs as well as iden-tifying multiple protein species (e.g. proteolytically processed protein species). Despite its advantages, top-down proteom-ics presents many challenges. These include requirement of high sample quantity, sophisticated instrumentation, protein separation, and robust computational analysis tools. For this reason, top-down proteomics has rarely been used for ana-lyzing complex mixtures (12–18), and it is typically used to study single purified proteins. However, this situation is quickly changing with recent top-down studies of complex protein mixtures (14, 19). Because of the existence of natural isotopes, fragment ions of the same chemical formula and charge state are usually represented by a collection of spectral peaks in tandem mass spectra called an isotopomer envelope. The monoisotopic mass of a chemical formula is the sum of the masses of the atoms using the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element. Spectral deconvolution focuses on grouping spectral peaks into isotopomer envelopes. By doing so, the charge state and monoisotopic mass of each envelope are effectively determined. A complex multi-isotopic peak list in the m/z space is translated into a simple monoisotopic mass list that is easier to analyze. Given the monoisotopic mass and charge state of a fragment ion, its theoretical isotopic distribution can be predicted by assuming the fragment ion has an average elemental composi-tion with respect to its mass (20) or using its precise elemental composition if the protein is known. Exploiting this, many de-convolution methods use theoretical isotopic distributions to detect and evaluate candidate isotopomer envelopes, which is the envelope detection problem (Fig. 1). To evaluate the fit of a candidate envelope to its theoretical isotopic distribution, many metrics have been proposed (20 –32). The candidate envelopes often overlap and share peaks, leading to a combinatorial problem of selecting the list of envelopes that best explains the spectrum (Fig. 2). In contrast to the well studied envelope detection problem, the envelope selection problem remains poorly explored. Most deconvolu-tion algorithms follow a simple greedy approach to selecting the set of envelopes where the highest scoring envelopes are From the},

abstract = {The rapid growth of approved biotherapeutics, e.g., monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulins G (IgGs), demands improved techniques for their quality control. Traditionally, proteolysis-based bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) has been employed. However, the long, multistep sample preparation protocols required for bottom-up MS are known to potentially introduce artifacts in the original sample. For this reason, a top-down MS approach would be preferable. The current performance of top-down MS of intact monoclonal IgGs, though, enables reaching only up to ∼30{\%} sequence coverage, with incomplete sequencing of the complementarity determining regions which are fundamental for IgG's antigen binding. Here, we describe a middle-down MS protocol based on the use of immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS), which is capable of digesting IgGs in only 30 min. After chemical reduction, the obtained ∼25 kDa proteolytic fragments were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled online with an electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-enabled hybrid Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Elite FTMS). Upon optimization of ETD and product ion transfer parameters, results show that up to ∼50{\%} sequence coverage for selected IgG fragments is reached in a single LC run and up to ∼70{\%} when data obtained by distinct LC−MS runs are averaged. Importantly, we demonstrate the potential of this middle-down approach in the identification of oxidized methionine residues. The described approach shows a particular potential for the analysis of IgG mixtures.},

@article{Wang2019a,
abstract = {Detecting autoimmune diseases at an early stage is crucial for effective treatment and disease management to slow disease progression and prevent irreversible organ damage. In many autoimmune diseases, disease-specific autoantibodies are produced by B cells in response to soluble autoantigens due to defects in B cell tolerance mechanisms. Autoantibodies accrue early in disease development, and several are so disease-specific they serve as classification criteria. In this study, we established a high-throughput, sensitive, intact serum autoantibody analysis platform based on the optimization of a one dimensional ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography top-down mass spectrometry platform (1D UPLC-TDMS). This approach has been successfully applied to a 12 standard monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) mixture, demonstrating the feasibility to separate and sequence intact antibodies with high sequence coverage and high sensitivity. We then applied the optimized platform to characterize total serum antibody Fabs in a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient sample and compared it to healthy control samples. From this analysis, we show that the SLE sample has many dominant antibody Fab-related mass features unlike the healthy controls. To our knowledge, this is the first top-down demonstration of serum autoantibody pool analysis. Our proposed approach holds great promise for discovering novel serum autoantibody biomarkers that are of interest for diagnosis, prognosis, and tolerance induction, as well as improving our understanding of pathogenic autoimmune processes.},

@article{Frank2008,
abstract = {Recent advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation, such as FTICR and OrbiTrap, have made it possible to generate high-resolution spectra of entire proteins. While these methods offer new opportunities for performing "top-down" studies of proteins, the computational tools for analyzing top-down data are still scarce. In this paper we investigate the application of spectral alignment to the problem of identifying protein forms in top-down mass spectra (i.e., identifying the modifications, mutations, insertions, and deletions). We demonstrate how spectral alignment efficiently discovers protein forms even in the presence of numerous modifications and how the algorithm can be extended to discover positional isomers from spectra of mixtures of isobaric protein forms.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe pharmaceutical industry's interest in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their derivatives has spurred rapid growth in the commercial and clinical pipeline of these effective therapeutics. The complex micro-heterogeneity of mAbs requires in-depth structural characterization for critical quality attribute assessment and quality assurance. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods are the gold standard in mAb analysis, primarily with a bottom-up approach in which immunoglobulins G (IgGs) and their variants are digested into peptides to facilitate the analysis. Comprehensive characterization of IgGs and the micro-variants remains challenging at the proteoform level. Here, we used both top-down and middle-down MS for in-depth characterization of a human IgG1 using ultra-high resolution Fourier transform MS. Our top-down MS analysis provided characteristic fingerprinting of the IgG1 proteoforms at unit mass resolution. Subsequently, the tandem MS analysis of intact IgG1 enabled the detailed seq...},
