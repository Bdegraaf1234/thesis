abstract = {In shotgun proteomics, tandem mass spectra of peptides are typically identified through database search algorithms such as Sequest. We have developed DirecTag, an open-source algorithm to infer partial sequence tags directly from observed fragment ions. This algorithm is unique in its implementation of three separate scoring systems to evaluate each tag on the basis of peak intensity, m/z fidelity, and complementarity. In data sets from several types of mass spectrometers, DirecTag reproducibly exceeded the accuracy and speed of InsPecT and GutenTag, two previously published algorithms for this purpose. The source code and binaries for DirecTag are available from http://fenchurch.mc.vanderbilt.edu.},

abstract = {De novo sequencing of peptides using tandem MS is difficult due to missing fragment ions in the spectra commonly obtained after CID of peptide precursor ions. Complementing CID spectra with spectra obtained in an ion-trap mass spectrometer upon electron transfer dissociation (ETD) significantly increases the sequence coverage with diagnostic ions. In the de novo sequencing algorithm CompNovo presented here, a divide-and-conquer approach was combined with an efficient mass decomposition algorithm to exploit the complementary information contained in CID and ETD spectra. After optimizing the parameters for the algorithm on a well-defined training data set obtained for peptides from nine known proteins, the CompNovo algorithm was applied to the de novo sequencing of peptides derived from a whole protein extract of Sorangium cellulosum bacteria. To 2406 pairs of CID and ETD spectra contained in this data set, 675 fully correct sequences were assigned, which represent a success rate of 28.1{\%}. It is shown that the CompNovo algorithm yields significantly improved sequencing accuracy as compared with published approaches using only CID spectra or combined CID and ETD spectra.},

abstract = {There are two approaches for de novo protein sequencing: Edman degradation and mass spectrometry (MS). Existing MS-based methods characterize a novel protein by assembling tandem mass spectra of overlapping peptides generated from multiple proteolytic digestions of the protein. Because each tandem mass spectrum covers only a short peptide of the target protein, the key to high coverage protein sequencing is to find spectral pairs from overlapping peptides in order to assemble tandem mass spectra to long ones. However, overlapping regions of peptides may be too short to be confidently identified. High-resolution mass spectrometers have become accessible to many laboratories. These mass spectrometers are capable of analyzing molecules of large mass values, boosting the development of top-down MS. Top-down tandem mass spectra cover whole proteins.

abstract = {Dependent on concise, predefined protein sequence databases, traditional search algorithms perform poorly when analyzing mass spectra derived from wholly uncharacterized protein products. Conversely, de novo peptide sequencing algorithms can interpret mass spectra without relying on reference databases. However, such algorithms have been difficult to apply to complex protein mixtures, in part due to a lack of methods for automatically validating de novo sequencing results. Here, we present novel metrics for benchmarking de novo sequencing algorithm performance on large-scale proteomics data sets and present a method for accurately calibrating false discovery rates on de novo results. We also present a novel algorithm (LADS) that leverages experimentally disambiguated fragmentation spectra to boost sequencing accuracy and sensitivity. LADS improves sequencing accuracy on longer peptides relative to that of other algorithms and improves discriminability of correct and incorrect sequences. Using these advancements, we demonstrate accurate de novo identification of peptide sequences not identifiable using database search-based approaches.},

abstract = {Shotgun proteomics is a powerful tool for identifying the protein content of complex mixtures via liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The most widely used class of algorithms for analyzing mass spectra of peptides has been database search software such as SEQUEST. A new sequence tag database search algorithm, called GutenTag, makes it possible to identify peptides with unknown posttranslational modifications or sequence variations. This software automates the process of inferring partial sequence "tags" directly from the spectrum and efficiently examines a sequence database for peptides that match these tags. When multiple candidate sequences result from the database search, the software evaluates which is the best match by a rapid examination of spectral fragment ions. We compare GutenTag's accuracy to that of SEQUEST on a defined protein mixture, showing that both modified and unmodified peptides can be successfully identified by this approach. GutenTag analyzed 33 000 spectra from a human lens sample, identifying peptides that were missed in prior SEQUEST analysis due to sequence polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications. The software is available under license; visit http://fields.scripps.edu for information. Tandem mass spectrometry has been established as a powerful analytical tool for proteomics. Hunt and others 1 demonstrated the ability to sequence peptides directly from tandem mass spectra in the mid-1980s. Yates and Eng 2 automated this process by comparing database-derived sequences to uninterpreted tandem mass spectra. Improved separation technologies automated the analysis of samples ranging from protein complexes 3 to whole cell lysates 4 for protein content and protein modifications. As these technologies have been refined, the emphasis in proteomics has shifted from protein identification to posttranslational modification identification 5 and protein quantitation. 6 Tandem mass spectra of peptides reveal sequences because they show the fragmentation products of peptides. 7 Ions of a peptide eluting from liquid chromatography are isolated by the mass spectrometer and collided energetically with inert gas molecules. Each peptide precursor breaks preferentially at a peptide bond, producing two fragments (one from the N-terminal b series, and one from the C-terminal y series). The fragment ions from thousands of such breakages form a tandem mass spectrum, where each ion is represented by a peak with a recorded intensity and a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. Each tandem mass spectrum indicates the sequence of a peptide by two superimposed ladders of sequence ions, though typically some fragment ions from each series do not appear in the spectrum.

abstract = {Full-length de novo sequencing from tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of unknown proteins such as antibodies or proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes remains a challenging open problem. Conventional algorithms designed to individually sequence each MS/MS spectrum are limited by incomplete peptide fragmentation or low signal to noise ratios and tend to result in short de novo sequences at low sequencing accuracy. Our shotgun protein sequencing (SPS) approach was developed to ameliorate these limitations by first finding groups of unidentified spectra from the same peptides (contigs) and then deriving a consensus de novo sequence for each assembled set of spectra (contig sequences). But whereas SPS enables much more accurate reconstruction of de novo sequences longer than can be recovered from individual MS/MS spectra, it still requires error-tolerant matching to homologous proteins to group smaller contig sequences into full-length protein sequences, thus limiting its effectiveness on sequences from poorly annotated proteins. Using low and high resolution CID and high resolution HCD MS/MS spectra, we address this limitation with a Meta-SPS algorithm designed to overlap and further assemble SPS contigs into Meta-SPS de novo contig sequences extending as long as 100 amino acids at over 97{\%} accuracy without requiring any knowledge of homologous protein sequences. We demonstrate Meta-SPS using distinct MS/MS data sets obtained with separate enzymatic digestions and discuss how the remaining de novo sequencing limitations relate to MS/MS acquisition settings.},

abstract = {We introduce the use of a peptide composition lookup table indexed by residual mass and number of amino acids for de novo sequencing of polypeptides. Polypeptides of 1600 Daltons (Da) or more can be sequenced effectively through exhaustive compositional analysis of MS/MS spectra obtained by unimolecular decomposition (without CID) in a MALDI TOF/ TOF despite a fragment mass accuracy of 50 mDa. Peaks are referenced against the lookup table to obtain a complete profile of amino acid combinations, and combinations are assembled into series of increasing length. Concatenating the differences between successive entries in compositional series yields peptide sequences that can be scored and ranked according to signal intensity.

abstract = {Background Liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics for peptide identification. Liquid chromatography temporally separates the peptides in a sample. The peptides that elute one after another are analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide and its fragments. De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. Results We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Conclusions Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.},

abstract = {De novo sequencing of peptides poses one of the most challenging tasks in data analysis for proteome research. In this paper, a generative hidden Markov model (HMM) of mass spectra for de novo peptide sequencing which constitutes a novel view on how to solve this problem in a Bayesian framework is proposed. Further extensions of the model structure to a graphical model and a factorial HMM to substantially improve the peptide identification results are demonstrated. Inference with the graphical model for de novo peptide sequencing estimates posterior probabilities for amino acids rather than scores for single symbols in the sequence. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for de novo peptide sequencing on a large test set of spectra. In the process of high-throughput protein identification, mass spectrometry has attained considerable importance during the most recent years. 1 Analysis based on mass spectrometry typically starts with a complex protein mixture which is fractionated by either gel electrophoresis or other fractionation methods to reduce the complexity of the sample. The proteins are then digested by a specific enzyme, such as trypsin. The resulting set of peptides is measured by a tandem mass spectrometer coupled with a high performance liquid chromatography device. In the first measurement stage of a tandem mass spectrometer, the total mass of the different peptides eluting at a certain time point from the column is determined. In the second stage, a subset of peptides of a certain small mass range is selected. These peptides are fragmented by low-energy collision with a noble gas. This fragmentation process finally yields the MS/MS spectra that ideally contain the masses of all N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of the designated peptides. The inherently high noise level of mass spectra in high-throughput experiments strongly favors probabilistic models of the data generation process. In this paper, we propose NovoHMM, a novel and completely generative statistical model for mass spectra which arise from peptide sequences. 1 (A preliminary version of this model was presented at the NIPS conference. 2) The data generation process is assumed to be adequately described by a hidden Markov model with hidden amino acid states along the mass axis of a spectrum and observable emissions of mass peaks for each state. The model is generative in the sense that typical spectra can be sampled from the estimated model, given a peptide sequence. The complete HMM produces computational costs which scale quadratically in the number of states. To reduce the computational and model complexity, the complete model is approximated by a factorial hidden Markov model. The factorial model implicitly estimates whether a certain peak has been generated by an N-terminal or a C-terminal fragment. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used to estimate these hidden variables. The complexity regularization mechanism by factorization leads to an improved predictive power of the model. As a particular advantage for inference, NovoHMM explicitly represents probabilistic estimates of the posterior, both for the whole sequence and for single amino acids. In the Experimental Section, we compare NovoHMM with other de novo peptide sequencing methods, especially with PepNovo 3 which presumably is the best existing de novo sequenc-ing method for doubly charged ion trap spectra. The experiments effectively show that our approach outperforms PepNovo and other competitors on the same benchmark dataset on which PepNovo was tested. In addition, we show that the model yields reliable estimates of the peptide's parent masses. The Bayesian modeling approach allows us to provide a fully probabilistic posterior estimate for each amino acid. Related Work. The interpretation of the tandem MS spectra usually starts with a database search in cases for which a database of known proteins is available for the organism under investigation. The most popular database search tools are SEQUEST 4 and MASCOT. 5 In recent publications, probabilistic models for database searches have been reported, such as OLAV 6 and SCOPE. 7 (2) Fischer, B.; Roth, V.; Buhmann, J.

In this paper, we present a new approach to peptide de novo sequencing, called MSNovo, which has the following advanced features. (1) It works on data generated from both LCQ and LTQ mass spectrometers and interprets singly, doubly, and triply charged ions. (2) It integrates a new probabilistic scoring function with a mass array-based dynamic programming algorithm. The simplicity of the scoring function, with only 6-10 parameters to be trained, avoids the problem of overfitting and allows MSNovo to be adopted for other machines and data sets easily. The mass array data structure explicitly encodes all possible peptides and allows the dynamic programming algorithm to find the best peptide. (3) Compared to existing programs, MSNovo predicts pep-tides as well as sequence tags with a higher accuracy, which is important for those applications that search protein databases using the de novo sequencing results. More specifically, we show that MSNovo outperforms other programs on various ESI ion trap data. We also show that for high-resolution data the performance of MSNovo improves significantly.

The various features of the mathematical model are presented and examples are used to illustrate the key concepts of the proposed approach. A variety of challenging peptide identification problems, accompanied by a comparative study with five state-of-the-art methods, are examined to illustrate the proposed method's ability to address (a) residue-dependent fragmentation properties that result in missing ion peaks and (b) the variability of resolution in different mass analyzers. A preprocessing algorithm is utilized to identify important m/z values in the tandem mass spectrum. Missing peaks, due to residue-dependent fragmentation characteristics, are dealt with using a two-stage algorithmic framework. A cross-correlation approach is used to resolve missing amino acid assignments and to select the most probable peptide by comparing the theoretical spectra of the candidate sequences that were generated from the ILP sequencing stages with the experimental tandem mass spectrum. The novel, proposed de novo method, denoted as PILOT, is compared to existing popular methods such as Lutefisk, PEAKS, PepNovo, EigenMS, and NovoHMM for a set of spectra resulting from QTOF and ion trap instruments. Of fundamental importance in proteomics is the problem of peptide and protein identification. Over the past couple decades, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography has emerged as a powerful experimental technique for the effective identification of peptides and proteins. A description of the various experimental frameworks for separation, ionization, and measurement techniques can be found elsewhere. 1,2 In recognition of the extensive amount of sequence information embedded in a single mass spectrum, tandem MS has served as an impetus for the recent development of numerous computational approaches formulated to sequence peptides robustly and efficiently with particular emphasis on the integration of these algorithms into a high-throughput computational framework for proteomics. The two most frequently reported computational approaches in the literature are (a) de novo and (b) database search methods, both of which can utilize determin-istic, probabilistic, or stochastic solution techniques. The majority of peptide identification methods used in industry are database search methods 3-11 due to their accuracy and their ability to exploit organism information during the identification. An essential component in database methods is a model for scoring the experimental tandem mass spectra against the theoretical spectra of a peptide obtained from a protein database. The main difference between these database methods lies in the type of scoring function utilized to rank-order the most probable peptide matches and the type of sequence database in which the search is conducted. These database types include protein sequence, genomic, or expressed sequence tag. A variety of techniques for peptide identification using databases currently exist. One approach, as implemented in the SEQUEST algorithm, 3-5 uses a signal-processing technique known as cross-correlation to mathematically determine the overlap between a theoretical spectrum as derived from a sequence in the database and the experimental spectrum under investigation. The more frequently used technique, known as probability-based matching, utilizes a probabilistic model to determine whether an ion peak match between the experimental and theoretical tandem mass spectrum is actual or random. 6,8,9,11 Various models have been proposed for this purpose, ranging from a likelihood ratio hypothesis test 8,11 to the null hypothesis that peptide matches are random. 9 Spectral dependencies from empirical observations are often integrated into these models to enhance the predictive capabilities. Despite the sophistication of these database methods, they are ineffective if the database in which the search is conducted does not contain the corresponding peptide responsible for generating the tandem mass spectrum.

To address this problem, we propose an integrated system, ALPS, which for the first time can automatically assemble full-length monoclonal antibody sequences. Our system integrates de novo sequencing peptides, their quality scores and error-correction information from databases into a weighted de Bruijn graph to assemble protein sequences. We evaluated ALPS performance on two antibody data sets, each including a heavy chain and a light chain. The results show that ALPS was able to assemble three complete monoclonal antibody sequences of length 216-441 AA, at 100{\%} coverage, and 96.64-100{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {There are several computer programs that can match peptide tandem mass spectrometry data to their exactly corresponding database sequences, and in most protein identification projects, these programs are utilized in the early stages of data interpretation. However, situations frequently arise where tandem mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequences. In these cases, the unmatched data could be due to peptides derived from novel proteins, allelic or species-derived variants of known proteins, or posttranslational or chemical modifications. Two additional problems are frequently encountered in high-throughput protein identification. First, it is difficult to quickly sift through large amounts of data to identify those spectra that, due to poor signal or contaminants, can be ignored. Second, it is important to find incorrect database matches (false positives). We have chosen to address these difficulties by performing automatic de novo sequencing using a computer program called Lutefisk. Sequence candidates obtained are used as input in a homology-based database search program called CIDentify to identify variants of known proteins. Comparison of database-derived sequences with de novo sequences allows for electronic validation of database matches even if the latter are not completely correct. Modifications to the original Lutefisk program have been implemented to handle data obtained from triple quadrupole, ion trap, and quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid (Qtof) mass spectrometers. For example, the linearity of mass errors due to temperature-dependent expansion of the flight tube in a Qtof was exploited such that isobaric amino acids (glutamine/lysine and oxidized methionine/ phenylalanine) can be differentiated without careful attention to mass calibration.},

Protein sequences absent from the database cannot be identified, and even if present in the database, complete sequence coverage is rarely achieved even for the most abundant proteins in the sample. Thus, sequencing of unknown proteins such as antibodies or constituents of metaproteomes remains a challenging problem. To date, there is no available method for full-length protein sequencing, independent of a reference database, in high throughput. Here, we present Database-independent Protein Sequencing, a method for unambiguous, rapid, database-independent, full-length protein sequencing. The method is a novel combination of non-enzymatic, semi-random cleavage of the protein, LC-MS/MS analysis, peptide de novo sequencing, extraction of peptide tags, and their assembly into a consensus sequence using an algorithm named "Peptide Tag Assembler." As proof-of-concept, the method was applied to samples of three known proteins representing three size classes and to a previously un-sequenced, clinically relevant monoclonal antibody. Excluding leucine/isoleucine and glutamic acid/deamidated glutamine ambiguities, end-to-end full-length de novo sequencing was achieved with 99-100{\%} accuracy for all benchmarking proteins and the antibody light chain. Accuracy of the sequenced antibody heavy chain, including the entire variable region, was also 100{\%}, but there was a 23-residue gap in the constant region sequence.},

abstract = {De novo protein sequencing of monoclonal antibodies is required when the cDNA or the original cell line is not available, or when characterization of posttranslational modifications is needed to verify antibody integrity and effectiveness. We demonstrate that Comparative Shotgun Protein Sequencing (CSPS) based on tandem mass spectrometry can reduce the time required to sequence an antibody to 72 hours, a dramatic reduction as compared to the classical technique of Edman degradation. We therefore argue that CSPS has the potential to be a disruptive technology for all protein sequencing applications. Antibodies have been exploited as indispensable reagents for biomedical research and as diagnostic and therapeutic agents 1, 2. The specificity and effector functions of antibodies are highly dependent on the amino acid sequence and the presence (or absence) of specific modifications 3. Although DNA sequencing is routinely used in the initial characterization of monoclonal antibodies, subsequent mutations and modifications are typically recognized by analysis at the protein level. Pre-clinical antibodies may be derived from immunized hosts, commercial sources, gifts from collaborators, or from hybridomas that no longer secrete antibodies and for which the cDNA is not available. It is therefore critical to sequence the antibodies in order to monitor the integrity of the molecule, to troubleshoot performance in pre-clinical assays, to regenerate cDNA by reverse engineering, ultimately to perform quality control 4. In addition, protein-level rearrangements (such as observed on IG4 antibodies) can only be revealed by protein level analysis. Sequencing of (unknown) proteins (and antibodies in particular) remains a challenge. Since antibodies are not directly inscribed in the genome and are constantly created anew, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) database search approaches are not applicable, making Edman degradation the only viable option 5. This is a low-throughput and time-consuming approach since it is characterized by short peptide reads (limited to about 30 aa), requires proteolytic digestion, peptide fractionation, and peptide-by-peptide sequencing. Mass spectrometry can rapidly generate data that can be used either for cDNA primer design (followed by ≈2 weeks of additional experiments) or combined with Edman degradation to expedite sequencing 6. While this hybrid MS/MS+Edman approach has been successfully applied to the de novo sequencing of antibodies 4 , the Achilles heel of MS/MS sequencing has been the interpretation of spectra (the accuracy of MS/MS sequencing algorithms remains low with only {\~{}}30{\%} of spectra correctly reconstructed 7-9). Bridging this MS/MS sequencing gap not only significantly reduces the total sequencing time but also considerably reduces the sequencing},

De novo sequencing is the computational step to derive a peptide sequence from an MS/MS spectrum, normally by constructing the peptide that maximizes the scoring function. A number of polynomial time algorithms have been developed based on scoring functions that consider only either the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment ions of the peptide. It remains unknown whether the consideration of the internal fragment ions will still be polynomial time solvable. In this paper, we prove that the internal fragment ions make the de novo sequencing problem NP-complete. We also propose a regression model based scoring method to incorporate correlations between the fragment ions. Our scoring function is combined with PEAKS de novo sequencing algorithm and tested on ion trap data. The experimental results show that the regression model based scoring method can remarkably improve the de novo sequencing accuracy.},

abstract = {Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches. In this paper we present ANTILOPE, a new fast and flexible approach based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and works with a variety of scoring schemes. ANTILOPE combines Lagrangian relaxation for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an adaptation of Yen's k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant improvement in running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs at the same speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a generic probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a dataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type. Evaluations on benchmark data show that ANTILOPE is competitive to the popular state-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and accuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of considered ion types. ANTILOPE will be freely available as part of the open source proteomics library OpenMS.},

abstract = {Full-length de novo sequencing of unknown proteins remains a challenging open problem. Traditional methods that sequence spectra individually are limited by short peptide length, incomplete peptide fragmentation, and ambiguous de novo interpretations. We address these issues by determining consensus sequences for assembled tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra from overlapping peptides (e.g., by using multiple enzymatic digests). We have combined electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation methods to boost interpretation of long, highly charged peptides and take advantage of corroborating b/y/c/z ions in CID/HCD/ETD. Using these strategies, we show that triplet CID/HCD/ETD MS/MS spectra from overlapping peptides yield de novo sequences of average length 70 AA and as long as 200 AA at up to 99{\%} sequencing accuracy.},

abstract = {De novo peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry represents an important strategy for characterizing novel peptides and proteins, in which a peptide's amino acid sequence is inferred directly from the precursor peptide mass and tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS or MS 3) fragment ions, without comparison to a reference proteome. This method is ideal for organisms or samples lacking a complete or well-annotated reference sequence set. One of the major barriers to de novo spectral interpretation arises from confusion of N-and C-terminal ion series due to the symmetry between b and y ion pairs created by collisional activation methods (or c, z ions for electron-based activation methods). This is known as the "antisymmetric path problem" and leads to inverted amino acid subsequences within a de novo reconstruction. Here, we combine several key strategies for de novo peptide sequencing into a single high-throughput pipeline: high-efficiency carbamylation blocks lysine side chains, and subsequent tryptic digestion and N-terminal peptide derivatization with the ultraviolet chromophore AMCA yield peptides susceptible to 351 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD). UVPD-MS/MS of the AMCA-modified peptides then predominantly produces y ions in the MS/MS spectra, specifically addressing the antisymmetric path problem. Finally, the program UVnovo applies a random forest algorithm to automatically learn from and then interpret UVPD mass spectra, passing results to a hidden Markov model for de novo sequence prediction and scoring. We show this combined strategy provides high-performance de novo peptide sequencing, enabling the de novo sequencing of thousands of peptides from an Escherichia coli lysate at high confidence. T he breadth of proteomic studies has never been greater, as a growing trend in proteomics research pushes mass spectrometry experiments beyond the study of model organisms, proteotypic peptides, and common posttranslational modifications. This strains the limits of traditional spectral interpretation using sequence databases, and it has driven development of more flexible search methods and proteoge-nomic pipelines. De novo peptide and protein sequencing is one potential strategy for characterizing novel peptides. 1 Rather than comparing a peptide spectrum to theoretical candidate spectra from a reference protein sequence database, de novo analysis directly infers a peptide sequence from the precursor peptide mass and tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS or MS 3) fragment ions. 2 This method is ideal for organisms or samples lacking a complete or well-annotated reference sequence set. In the event that gene sequences are available, de novo approaches are well-suited for interpreting unidentified spectra and discovering unknown splice variants, intergenic peptides, sequence polymorphisms, and other novel peptides. Given an ideal MS/MS spectrum, de novo peptide sequence assignment is a trivial exercise. Such a spectrum would exhibit a complete series of ions, all of a single-fragment type (N-terminal a/b/c or C-terminal x/y/z ions) and known charge state, that span an entire precursor peptide. The sequence could then be read directly from the spectrum by matching the mass difference between each consecutive ion pair to its corresponding amino acid. Technological developments, notably high-resolution MS/MS acquisition and concurrent collection of complementary fragmentation spectra (e.g., paired collision-induced dissociation (CID)/electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectra), have greatly improved the potential of de novo peptide sequencing, but spectra still suffer from incomplete peptide fragmentation, complex fragmentation patterns and neutral losses, and uninterpretable noise. CID, 3,4 HCD, 5 ETD, 6,7 and dual fragmentation (EThcD, ETciD), 8 have all been applied for de novo sequencing. Infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and ultraviolet photo},

The software is capable of probing the sequence of an unknown peptide, and even of certain modified peptides. The program, compiled for WINDOWS95 or NT, also permits the retrieval of raw data and the reconstruction of the spectra on a user-friendly graphical interface with the aid of several tools for processing the spectra, which include setting multiple threshold levels and automatic peak detection. SeqMS is capable of generating candidate sequences, based on the detected peaks, and of displaying the resulting assignments for each candidate in a spectrum or in tabular form. The software has the following capabilities: 1) the ions derived from backbone and side-chain fragmentations, internal and immonium ions, and side-chain loss ions can be used for calculation; 2) 18O-labeling of a peptide at the C terminus, a methodology which was developed to differentiate N-terminal from C-terminal ions, is applicable as an optional setting; 3) modified amino acids and N- or C-terminal blocking groups are taken into account for calculation according to the user's setting in a library; 4) amino acid composition and partial or complete amino acid sequence of a peptide can be used as input for calculation; 5) the assignments of signal output in a spectrum can be graphically edited, and then re-calculated based on the edited peaks. The efficacy of the program is demonstrated by testing 74 high-energy CID spectra, obtained using a four-sector instrument, of synthetic, proteolytic, and biologically active peptides, some of which contain modified groups.},

abstract = {Database search algorithms are the primary workhorses for the identification of tandem mass spectra. However, these methods are limited to the identification of spectra for which peptides are present in the database, preventing the identification of peptides from mutated or alternatively spliced sequences. A variety of methods has been developed to search a spectrum against a sequence allowing for variations. Some tools determine the sequence of the homologous protein in the related species but do not report the peptide in the target organism. Other tools consider variations, including modifications and mutations , in reconstructing the target sequence. However, these tools will not work if the template (homologous peptide) is missing in the database, and they do not attempt to reconstruct the entire protein target sequence. De novo identification of peptide sequences is another possibility, because it does not require a protein database. However, the lack of database reduces the accuracy. We present a novel proteogenomic approach, GenoMS, that draws on the strengths of database and de novo peptide identification methods. Protein sequence templates (i.e. proteins or genomic sequences that are similar to the target protein) are identified using the database search tool InsPecT. The templates are then used to recruit, align, and de novo sequence regions of the target protein that have diverged from the database or are missing. We used GenoMS to reconstruct the full sequence of an antibody by using spectra acquired from multiple digests using different proteases. Antibodies are a prime example of proteins that confound standard database identification techniques. The mature antibody genes result from large-scale genome rearrangements with flexible fusion boundaries and somatic hypermutation. Using GenoMS we automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of two immunoglobulin chains with accuracy greater than 98{\%} using a diverged protein database. Using the genome as the template, we achieve accuracy exceeding 97{\%}.},

abstract = {Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovoþ, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides). Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines. UniNovo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd.edu/Software/UniNovo.html along with the manual.},

Results: In this study, a new de novo sequencing algorithm, called Vonode, has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. To fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra, a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions.

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing is generally more reliable on high-resolution instruments owing to their high resolution and mass accuracy. On a lower resolution instrument such as the more widely used quadrupole ion traps, de novo peptide sequencing is not so reliable or requires more MS 3 experiments. However, the peptide CID spectrum has been demonstrated to be quite reproducible on an ion trap instrument and can be predicted with good accuracy. A new de novo peptide sequencing technique, DACSIM, combining a divide-and-conquer algorithm for deriving sequence candidates and spectrum simulation for sequence refinement, is developed for spectra acquired on an ion trap instrument. When DACSIM was used to sequence peptides 500-1900 u in mass generated from proteolytic digests of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the success rate was 70{\%} with a false positive rate of only 6{\%}, when isoleucine and leucine residues were not distinguished. Peptide tandem mass spectra generated from low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) processes have been widely used in peptide sequence confirmation and protein identification by matching these tandem mass spectra to sequences in protein database. 1-6 When database search fails to provide the identification of a peptide, de novo sequencing is often performed to derive the sequence or partial sequence of the peptide. 7 Although some peptide modification schemes, either by chemical derivatization 8-13 or isotopic labeling, 14-20 have been used to simplify the spectrum interpretation, de novo sequencing from tandem spectra of unmodified peptides is often preferred. First, the extra step of wet chemistry is less desirable, especially when the procedure is sample limited. Second, de novo sequencing is often desired when a database search failed to provide identification of the precursor ion. In that case, tandem mass spectrum of the unmodified peptide is already available, and it is more desirable to derive the de novo sequence directly from this spectrum. A number of algorithms have been reported to derive the peptide sequence based on the tandem spectra of unmodified peptides. 21-34 Most of these algorithms generate high-score * Youngquist, R.

abstract = {De novo sequencing of proteins and peptides is one of the most important problems in mass spectrometry-driven proteomics. A variety of methods have been developed to accomplish this task from a set of bottom-up tandem (MS/MS) mass spectra. However, a more recently emerged top-down technology, now gaining more and more popularity, opens new perspectives for protein analysis and characterization, implying a need for efficient algorithms to process this kind of MS/MS data. Here, we describe a method that allows for the retrieval, from a set of top-down MS/MS spectra, of long and accurate sequence fragments of the proteins contained in the sample. To this end, we outline a strategy for generating high-quality sequence tags from top-down spectra, and introduce the concept of a T-Bruijn graph by adapting to the case of tags the notion of an A-Bruijn graph widely used in genomics. The output of the proposed approach represents the set of amino acid strings spelled out by optimal paths in the connected components...},

abstract = {De novo sequencing software has been widely used in proteomics to sequence new peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data. This study presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000 spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and incorporated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets, Novor sequenced 7{\%}-37{\%} more correct residues than the state-of-the-art de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude faster. Novor can de novo sequence more than 300 MS/MS spectra per second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed of today's mass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a new possibility to de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the spectral data.

To interpret these paired spectra, we modified the UVnovo de novo sequencing software to automatically learn from and interpret fragmentation spectra, provided a representative set of training data. This machine learning procedure, using random forests, synthesizes information from one or multiple complementary spectra, such as the CID/UVPD pairs, into peptide fragmentation site predictions.

Despite its widespread use the database-driven approach is limited, mainly because of its static search space. In contrast, de novo sequencing derives peptide sequence information in an unbiased manner, using only the fragment ion information from the tandem mass spectra. In recent years, with the improvements in MS instrumentation, various new methods have been proposed for de novo sequencing. This review article proposes an overview of existing de novo sequencing algorithms and software tools ranging from peptide sequencing to sequence-to-protein mapping. We describe various use cases where de novo sequencing was successfully applied. Finally, we highlight limitations of current methods and discuss new directions for a wider acceptance of de novo sequencing in the community. This article is protected by copyright.

@article{Bandeira2007,
abstract = {Despite significant advances in the identification of known proteins, the analysis of unknown proteins by MS/MS still remains a challenging open problem. Although Klaus Biemann recognized the potential of MS/MS for sequencing of unknown proteins in the 1980s, low throughput Edman degradation followed by cloning still remains the main method to sequence unknown proteins. The automated interpretation of MS/MS spectra has been limited by a focus on individual spectra and has not capitalized on the information contained in spectra of overlapping peptides. Indeed the powerful shotgun DNA se-quencing strategies have not been extended to automated protein sequencing. We demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of automated shotgun protein sequencing of protein mixtures by utilizing MS/MS spectra of overlapping and possibly modified peptides generated via multiple proteases of different specificities. We validate this approach by generating highly accurate de novo reconstructions of multiple regions of various proteins in western diamondback rattlesnake venom. We further argue that shotgun protein sequencing has the potential to overcome the limitations of current protein sequencing approaches and thus catalyze the otherwise impractical applications of proteomics methodologies in studies of unknown proteins. Molecular {\&} Cellular Pro-teomics 6:1123-1134, 2007. Current approaches to proteomics focus on the reliable identification of proteins under the assumption that all proteins of interest are known and present in a database. However , the limited availability of sequenced genomes and multiple mechanisms of protein variation often refute this assumption. Well known mechanisms of protein diversity include variable recombination and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (1). The vital importance of some of these novel proteins is directly reflected in the success of monoclonal antibody drugs such as Rituxan TM , Herceptin TM , and Avastin TM (2, 3), all derived from proteins that are not directly inscribed in any genome. Similarly multiple commercial drugs have been developed from proteins obtained from species whose genomes are not known. In particular, pep-tides and proteins isolated from venom have provided essential clues for drug design (4, 5); examples include drugs for controlling blood coagulation (6-8) and drugs for breast (9, 10) and ovarian (11) cancer treatment. Even so, the genomes of the venomous snakes, scorpions, and snails are unlikely to become available anytime soon. Despite this vital importance of novel proteins, the mainstream method for protein sequencing is still initiated by restrictive and low throughput Edman degradation (12, 13), a task made difficult by protein purification procedures, post-translational modifications, and blocked protein N termini. These problems gain additional relevance when one considers the unusually high level of variability and post-translational modifications in venom proteins (14, 15). Moreover the common labor-intensive approach of DNA cloning and sequenc-ing from Edman chemistry-derived primers requires the additional availability of expensive instrumentation and expertise. The primary function of venom is to immobilize prey, and prey animals vary in their susceptibility to venom. As a result, venom composition within snake species shows considerable geographical variation, an important consideration because snake bites (even by snakes of the same species) may require different treatments. Moreover the amount and number of different proteins and isoforms varies with gender, diet, etc. (16-18). These difficulties have been widely acknowledged (19, 20) and have motivated several attempts at de novo sequencing of MS/MS spectra from venom proteins (21, 22). However, all such attempts were made using traditional approaches that consider each MS/MS spectrum in isolation and thus face difficulties in the reliable interpretation of individual spectra (23-25). Conceptually sequencing a protein from a set of MS/MS spectra can be described by a simple analogy. Imagine a jewelry box with many identical copies of a specific model of bead necklaces. Although all the beads are identical, this model is characterized by having irregular distances between consecutive beads; the set of interbead distances is initially chosen by the designer, and all necklaces are then made using exactly the same specification. Now assume that one day you open your jewelry box and realize that someone has vandalized all the necklaces by cutting them to fragments at randomly chosen bead positions. Can you recover the original design of this model of necklaces as specified by the set of consecutive interbead distances? In this allegory interbead distances correspond to amino acid masses, and beads cor-From the ‡Department},

abstract = {De novo peptide sequencing has improved remarkably in the past decade as a result of better instruments and computational algorithms. However, de novo sequencing can correctly interpret only approximately 30{\%} of high- and medium-quality spectra generated by collision-induced dissociation (CID), which is much less than database search. This is mainly due to incomplete fragmentation and overlap of different ion series in CID spectra. In this study, we show that higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) is of great help to de novo sequencing because it produces high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra without the low-mass cutoff associated with CID in ion trap instruments. Besides, abundant internal and immonium ions in the HCD spectra can help differentiate similar peptide sequences. Taking advantage of these characteristics, we developed an algorithm called pNovo for efficient de novo sequencing of peptides from HCD spectra. pNovo gave correct identifications to 80{\%} or more of the HCD spectra identified by database search. The number of correct full-length peptides sequenced by pNovo is comparable with that obtained by database search. A distinct advantage of de novo sequencing is that deamidated peptides and peptides with amino acid mutations can be identified efficiently without extra cost in computation. In summary, implementation of the HCD characteristics makes pNovo an excellent tool for de novo peptide sequencing from HCD spectra.},

If the de novo sequencing gives correct tags, the homologs of the proteins can be identified by this approach and software such as MS-BLAST is available for the matching. However, de novo sequencing very often gives only partially correct tags. The most common error is that a segment of amino acids is replaced by another segment with approximately the same masses.
