abstract = {The importance of natural IgM antibodies in protection against infections is still emerging and these antibodies have a potential role in the maintenance of homeostasis through clearance of apoptotic bodies, complement-dependent mechanisms, inflammation and exclusion of misfolded proteins. Natural IgM act as a first line of defence against unknown hazardous factors and are present in most vertebrates. We investigated the functional capacity of anti-HIV-1 IgM monoclonal antibodies, from a combinatorial Fab library derived from healthy individuals, and evaluated their protective role in inhibiting HIV-1 in vitro when passing across the human mucosal epithelial barrier. Primary HIV-1 isolates were efficiently transmitted over the tight polarized epithelial cells when added to their apical surface. Efficient inhibition of HIV-1 transmission was achieved when anti-HIV-1 IgM monoclonal antibodies were added to the basolateral side of the cells. Two of these human IgM MoAbs had the ability to neutralize HIV and reduced infection of dendritic cells in primary cervico-vaginal tissue biopsies in vitro. This indicates a potential role of natural IgM antibodies in the reduction of HIV-1 transmission in mucosal tissues and improve our understanding of how natural IgM antibodies against a neutralizing epitope could interfere with viral transmission.},

abstract = {The analysis of concentrations of circulating antibodies in serum (antibody repertoire) is a fundamental, yet poorly studied, problem in immunoinformatics. The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the IgRepertoireConstructor algorithm that performs error-correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed antibody repertoires.},

abstract = {De novo sequencing of peptides using tandem MS is difficult due to missing fragment ions in the spectra commonly obtained after CID of peptide precursor ions. Complementing CID spectra with spectra obtained in an ion-trap mass spectrometer upon electron transfer dissociation (ETD) significantly increases the sequence coverage with diagnostic ions. In the de novo sequencing algorithm CompNovo presented here, a divide-and-conquer approach was combined with an efficient mass decomposition algorithm to exploit the complementary information contained in CID and ETD spectra. After optimizing the parameters for the algorithm on a well-defined training data set obtained for peptides from nine known proteins, the CompNovo algorithm was applied to the de novo sequencing of peptides derived from a whole protein extract of Sorangium cellulosum bacteria. To 2406 pairs of CID and ETD spectra contained in this data set, 675 fully correct sequences were assigned, which represent a success rate of 28.1{\%}. It is shown that the CompNovo algorithm yields significantly improved sequencing accuracy as compared with published approaches using only CID spectra or combined CID and ETD spectra.},

Here we report a simple and robust technique for the sequencing of proteins isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using nano-electrospray3,4 tandem mass spectrometry5,6. As little as 5 ng protein starting material on Coomassie- or silver-stained gels can be sequenced. Multiple-sequence stretches of up to 16 amino acids are obtained, which identify the protein unambiguously if already present in databases or provide information to clone the corresponding gene.

abstract = {Top-down proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) involves the mass measurement of an intact protein followed by subsequent activation of the protein to generate product ions. Electron-based fragmentation methods like electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) are widely used for these types of analysis. Recently, electron ionization dissociation (EID), which utilizes higher energy electrons ({\textgreater} 20 eV) has been suggested to be more efficient for top-down protein fragmentation compared to other electron-based dissociation methods. Here we demonstrate that the use of EID enhances protein fragmentation and subsequent detection of protein fragments. Protein product ions can form by either single cleavage events, resulting in terminal fragments containing the C-terminus or N-terminus of the protein, or by multiple cleavage events to give rise to internal fragments that include neither the C-terminus nor N-terminus of the protein. Conventionally, internal fragments have been disregarded as reliable assignments of these fragments were limited. Here, we demonstrate that internal fragments generated by EID can account for {\~{}}20-40{\%} of the mass spectral signals detected by top-down EID-MS experiments. By including internal fragments, the extent of the protein sequence that can be explained from a single tandem mass spectrum increases from {\~{}}50{\%} to {\~{}}99{\%} for 29 kDa carbonic anhydrase II and 8.6 kDa ubiquitin. When searching for internal fragments during data analysis, previously unassigned peaks can be readily and accurately assigned to confirm a given protein sequence and to enhance the utility of top-down protein sequencing experiments.},

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes plays a key role in antibody mediated immunity. SHM in B cells provides the molecular basis for affinity maturation of antibodies. In this way SHM is key in optimizing antibody dependent immune responses. SHM is initiated by targeting the Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) to rearranged V(D)J and switch regions of Ig genes. The mutation rate of this programmed mutagenesis is {\~{}}10−3 base pairs per generation, a million-fold higher than the non-AID targeted genome of B cells. AID is a processive enzyme that binds single-stranded DNA and deaminates cytosines in DNA. Cytosine deamination generates highly mutagenic deoxy-uracil (U) in the DNA of both strands of the Ig loci. Mutagenic processing of the U by the DNA damage response generates the entire spectrum of base substitutions characterizing SHM at and around the initial U lesion. Starting from the U as a primary lesion, currently five mutagenic DNA damage response pathways have been identified in generating a well-defined SHM spectrum of C/G transitions, C/G transversions, and A/T mutations around this initial lesion. These pathways include (1) replication opposite template U generates transitions at C/G, (2) UNG2-dependent translesion synthesis (TLS) generates transversions at C/G, (3) a hybrid pathway comprising non-canonical mismatch repair (ncMMR) and UNG2-dependent TLS generates transversions at C/G, (4) ncMMR generates mutations at A/T, and (5) UNG2- and PCNA Ubiquitination (PCNA-Ub)-dependent mutations at A/T. Furthermore, specific strand-biases of SHM spectra arise as a consequence of a biased AID targeting, ncMMR, and anti-mutagenic repriming. Here, we review mammalian SHM with special focus on the mutagenic DNA damage response pathways involved in processing AID induced Us, the origin of characteristic strand biases, and relevance of the cell cycle.},

The rapidly increasing database of spatial structures is a valuable source to improve alignment quality. We explore the use of 3D structural information to guide sequence alignments constructed by our MSA program PROMALS. The resulting tool, PROMALS3D, automatically identifies homologs with known 3D structures for the input sequences, derives structural constraints through structure-based alignments and combines them with sequence constraints to construct consistency-based multiple sequence alignments. The output is a consensus alignment that brings together sequence and structural information about input proteins and their homologs. PROMALS3D can also align sequences of multiple input structures, with the output representing a multiple structure-based alignment refined in combination with sequence constraints. The advantage of PROMALS3D is that it gives researchers an easy way to produce high-quality alignments consistent with both sequences and structures of proteins. PROMALS3D outperforms a number of existing methods for constructing multiple sequence or structural alignments using both reference-dependent and reference-independent evaluation methods.},

abstract = {A novel methodology for the automated de novo identification of peptides via integer linear optimization (also referred to as integer linear programming or ILP) and tandem mass spectrometry is presented in this article. The various features of the mathematical model are presented and examples are used to illustrate the key concepts of the proposed approach. A variety of challenging peptide identification problems, accompanied by a comparative study with five state-of-the-art methods, are examined to illustrate the proposed method's ability to address (a) residue-dependent fragmentation properties that result in missing ion peaks and (b) the variability of resolution in different mass analyzers. A preprocessing algorithm is utilized to identify important m/z values in the tandem mass spectrum. Missing peaks, due to residue-dependent fragmentation characteristics, are dealt with using a two-stage algorithmic framework. A cross-correlation approach is used to resolve missing amino acid assignments and to select the most probable peptide by comparing the theoretical spectra of the candidate sequences that were generated from the ILP sequencing stages with the experimental tandem mass spectrum. The novel, proposed de novo method, denoted as PILOT, is compared to existing popular methods such as Lutefisk, PEAKS, PepNovo, EigenMS, and NovoHMM for a set of spectra resulting from QTOF and ion trap instruments. Of fundamental importance in proteomics is the problem of peptide and protein identification. Over the past couple decades, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography has emerged as a powerful experimental technique for the effective identification of peptides and proteins. A description of the various experimental frameworks for separation, ionization, and measurement techniques can be found elsewhere. 1,2 In recognition of the extensive amount of sequence information embedded in a single mass spectrum, tandem MS has served as an impetus for the recent development of numerous computational approaches formulated to sequence peptides robustly and efficiently with particular emphasis on the integration of these algorithms into a high-throughput computational framework for proteomics. The two most frequently reported computational approaches in the literature are (a) de novo and (b) database search methods, both of which can utilize deterministic, probabilistic, or stochastic solution techniques. The majority of peptide identification methods used in industry are database search methods 3-11 due to their accuracy and their ability to exploit organism information during the identification. An essential component in database methods is a model for scoring the experimental tandem mass spectra against the theoretical spectra of a peptide obtained from a protein database. The main difference between these database methods lies in the type of scoring function utilized to rank-order the most probable peptide matches and the type of},

abstract = {Background The progression and geographical distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the United Kingdom (UK) and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland in the spring of 2020 to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression. Aim Our objective was to determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Results All samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5–6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic. Conclusion Although blood donors are not representative of the overall population, we demonstrated that serosurveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.},

abstract = {A comparative in vitro survey of physiologically relevant human and microbial proteinases defined a number of enzymes that induced specific hinge domain cleavage in human IgG1. Several of these proteinases have been associated with tumor growth, inflammation, and infection. A majority of the identified proteinases converted IgG to F(ab′)2, and a consistent feature of their action was a transient accumulation of a single-cleaved intermediate (scIgG). The scIgG resulted from the relatively rapid cleavage of the first hinge domain heavy chain, followed by a slower cleavage of the second chain to separate the Fc domain from F(ab′)2. Major sites of enzymatic cleavage were identified or confirmed from the mass of the F(ab′)2 or Fab fragments and/or the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the Fc for each enzyme including human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 3 and 12, human cathepsin G, human neutrophil elastase (Fab), staphylococcal glutamyl endopeptidase I and streptococcal immunoglobulin-degrading enzyme (IdeS). The cleavage sites in IgG1 by MMP-3, cathepsin G and IdeS were used to guide the synthesis of peptide analogs containing the corresponding carboxy-termini to be used as immunogens in rabbits. Rabbit antibodies were successfully generated that showed selective binding to different human F(ab′)2s and other hinge-cleavage fragments, but not to intact IgG. In Western blotting studies of synovial fluids from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, the rabbit antibodies yielded patterns consistent with the presence of endogenous IgG fragments including F(ab′)2 and the single-cleaved IgG intermediate. The detection in synovial fluid of IgG fragments similar to those observed in the in vitro biochemical studies suggests that proteolysis of IgG may contribute to localized immune dysfunction in inflammatory environments. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The origins of the various elements in the human antibody repertoire have been and still are subject to considerable uncertainty. Uncertainty in respect of whether the various elements have always served a specific defense function or whether they were co-opted from other organismal roles to form a crude na{\"{i}}ve repertoire that then became more complex as combinatorial mechanisms were added. Estimates of the current size of the human antibody na{\"{i}}ve repertoire are also widely debated with numbers anywhere from 10 million members, based on experimentally derived numbers, to in excess of one thousand trillion members or more, based on the different sequences derived from theoretical combinatorial calculations. There are questions that are relevant at both ends of this number spectrum. At the lower bound it could be questioned whether this is an insufficient repertoire size to counter all the potential antigen-bearing pathogens. At the upper bound the question is rather simpler: How can any individual interrogate such an astronomical number of antibody-bearing B cells in a timeframe that is meaningful? This review evaluates the evolutionary aspects of the adaptive immune system, the calculations that lead to the large repertoire estimates, some of the experimental evidence pointing to a more restricted repertoire whose variation appears to derive from convergent ‘structure and specificity features', and includes a theoretical model that seems to support it. Finally, a solution that may reconcile the size difference anomaly, which is still a hot subject of debate, is suggested.},

Thus, complete characterization of the protein primary structure often requires determination of the protein sequence by mass spectrometry with minimal assistance from genomic data - de novo protein sequencing.

These Fab glycans are acquired following introduction of N-glycosylation sites during somatic hypermutation and contribute to antibody diversification. We investigated whether Fab glycans may-in addition to affecting antigen binding-contribute to antibody stability. By analyzing thermal unfolding profiles of antibodies with or without Fab glycans, we demonstrate that introduction of Fab glycans can improve antibody stability. Strikingly, removal of Fab glycans naturally acquired during antigen-specific immune responses can deteriorate antibody stability, suggesting in vivo selection of stable, glycosylated antibodies. Collectively, our data show that variable domain N-linked glycans acquired during somatic hypermutation can contribute to IgG antibody stability. These findings indicate that introducing Fab glycans may represent a mechanism to improve therapeutic/diagnostic antibody stability.},

abstract = {In principle, humans can produce an antibody response to any non-self-antigen molecule in the appropriate context. This flexibility is achieved by the presence of a large repertoire of naive antibodies, the diversity of which is expanded by somatic hypermutation following antigen exposure1. The diversity of the naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least 1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 × 109, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires have been prohibitively difficult, primarily owing to their massive size. The amount of information encoded by all of the rearranged antibody and T cell receptor genes in one person-the 'genome' of the adaptive immune system-exceeds the size of the human genome by more than four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because much of the B lymphocyte population is localized in organs or tissues that cannot be comprehensively sampled from living subjects, human repertoire studies have focused on circulating B cells3. Here we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present what is, to our knowledge, the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy-chain sequences. This dataset enables genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at an unprecedented depth and granularity, which reveals largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and an exceptional overall diversity of the antibody repertoire.},

We have developed a new algorithm, SHERENGA, for de novo interpretation that automatically learns fragment ion types and intensity thresholds from a collection of test spectra generated from any type of mass spectrometer. The test data are used to construct optimal path scoring in the graph representations of MS/MS spectra. A ranked list of high scoring paths corresponds to potential peptide sequences.

SeqMS is capable of generating candidate sequences, based on the detected peaks, and of displaying the resulting assignments for each candidate in a spectrum or in tabular form. The software has the following capabilities: 1) the ions derived from backbone and side-chain fragmentations, internal and immonium ions, and side-chain loss ions can be used for calculation; 2) 18O-labeling of a peptide at the C terminus, a methodology which was developed to differentiate N-terminal from C-terminal ions, is applicable as an optional setting; 3) modified amino acids and N- or C-terminal blocking groups are taken into account for calculation according to the user's setting in a library; 4) amino acid composition and partial or complete amino acid sequence of a peptide can be used as input for calculation; 5) the assignments of signal output in a spectrum can be graphically edited, and then re-calculated based on the edited peaks. The efficacy of the program is demonstrated by testing 74 high-energy CID spectra, obtained using a four-sector instrument, of synthetic, proteolytic, and biologically active peptides, some of which contain modified groups.},

abstract = {Growth in the pharmaceutical industry has led to an increasing demand for rapid characterization of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The current methods for antibody sequence confirmation (e.g., N-terminal Edman sequencing and traditional peptide mapping methods) are not sufficient; thus, we developed a fast method for sequencing recombinant monoclonal antibodies using a novel digestion-on-emitter technology. Using this method, a monoclonal antibody can be denatured, reduced, digested, and sequenced in less than an hour. High throughput and satisfactory protein sequence coverage were achieved by using a non-specific protease from Aspergillus saitoi, protease XIII, to digest the denatured and reduced monoclonal antibody on an electrospray emitter, while electrospray high voltage was applied to the digestion mixture through the emitter. Tandem mass spectrometry data was acquired over the course of enzyme digestion, generating similar information compared to standard peptide mapping experiments in much less time. We demonstrated that this fast protein sequencing method provided sufficient sequence information for bovine serum albumin and two commercially available monoclonal antibodies, mouse IgG1 MOPC21 and humanized IgG1 NISTmAb. For two monoclonal antibodies, we obtained sequence coverage of 90.5–95.1{\%} for the heavy chains and 98.6–99.1{\%} for the light chains. We found that on-emitter digestion by protease XIII generated peptides of various lengths during the digestion process, which was critical for achieving sufficient sequence coverage. Moreover, we discovered that the enzyme-to-substrate ratio was an important parameter that affects protein sequence coverage. Due to its highly automatable and efficient design, our method offers a major advantage over N-terminal Edman sequencing and traditional peptide mapping methods in the identification of protein sequence, and is capable of meeting an ever-increasing demand for monoclonal antibody sequence confirmation in the biopharmaceutical industry.},

abstract = {Background: Segmental duplication and deletion were implicated for a region containing the human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene segments, 1.9III/hv3005 (possible allelic variants of IGHV3-30) and hv3019b9 (a possible allelic variant of IGHV3-33). However, very little is known about the ranges of the duplication and the polymorphic region. This is mainly because of the difficulty associated with distinguishing between allelic and paralogous sequences in the IGHV region containing extensive repetitive sequences. Inability to separate the two parental haploid genomes in the subjects is another serious barrier. To address these issues, unique DNA sequence tags evenly distributed within and flanking the duplicated region implicated by the previous studies were selected. The selected tags in single sperm from six unrelated healthy donors were amplified by multiplex PCR followed by microarray detection. In this way, individual haplotypes of different parental origins in the sperm donors could be analyzed separately and precisely. The identified polymorphic region was further analyzed at the nucleotide sequence level using sequences from the three human genomic sequence assemblies in the database. Results: A large polymorphic region was identified using the selected sequence tags. Four of the 12 haplotypes were shown to contain consecutively undetectable tags spanning in a variable range. Detailed analysis of sequences from the genomic sequence assemblies revealed two large duplicate sequence blocks of 24,696 bp and 24,387 bp, respectively, and an incomplete copy of 961 bp in this region. It contains up to 13 IGHV gene segments depending on haplotypes. A polymorphic region was found to be located within the duplicated blocks. The variants of this polymorphism unusually diverged at the nucleotide sequence level and in IGHV gene segment number, composition and organization, indicating a limited selection pressure in general. However, the divergence level within the gene segments is significantly different from that in the intergenic regions indicating that these regions may have been subject to different selection pressures and that the IGHV gene segments in this region are functionally important. Conclusions: Non-reciprocal genetic rearrangements associated with large duplicate sequence blocks could substantially contribute to the IGHV region diversity. Since the resulting polymorphisms may affect the number, composition and organization of the gene segments in this region, it may have significant impact on the function of the IGHV gene segment repertoire, antibody diversity, and therefore, the immune system. Because one of the gene segments, 3-30 (1.9III), is associated with autoimmune diseases, it could be of diagnostic significance to learn about the variants in the haplotypes by using the multiplex haplotype analysis system used in the present study with DNA sequence tags specific for the variants of all gene segments in this region.},

RESULTS: Very often, although the target protein is novel, it has a homologous protein included in a known database.

Validation with two standard proteins showed that our automated method yields {\textgreater}99{\%} sequence coverage and 100{\%} sequence accuracy on these two proteins.

abstract = {Abundant evidence points to a critical role for antibodies in protection and pathology across infectious diseases. While the antibody variable domain facilitates antibody binding and the blockade of infection, the constant domain (Fc) mediates cross talk with the innate immune system. The biological activity of the Fc region is controlled genetically via class switch recombination, resulting in the selection of distinct antibody isotypes and subclasses. However, a second modification is made to all antibodies, via post-translational changes in antibody glycosylation. Studies from autoimmunity and oncology have established the role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc glycosylation as a key regulator of humoral immune activity. However, a growing body of literature, exploring IgG Fc glycosylation through the lens of infectious diseases, points to the role of inflammation in shaping Fc-glycan profiles, the remarkable immune plasticity in antibody glycosylation across pathogen-exposed populations, the canonical and noncanonical functions of glycans and the existence of antigen-specific control over antibody Fc glycosylation. Ultimately, this work provides critical new insights into the functional roles for antibody glycosylation as well as lays the foundation for leveraging antibody glycosylation to drive prevention or control across diseases.},

abstract = {Influenza is a leading cause of death in the elderly, and the vaccine protects only a fraction of this population. A key aspect of antibody-mediated anti-influenza virus immunity is adaptation to antigenically distinct epitopes on emerging strains. We examined factors contributing to reduced influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly and uncovered a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of de novo immunoglobulin gene somatic mutations upon vaccination. This reduction is associated with a significant decrease in the capacity of antibodies to target the viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and critical protective epitopes surrounding the HA receptor-binding domain. Immune escape by antigenic drift, in which viruses generate mutations in key antigenic epitopes, becomes highly exaggerated. Because of this reduced adaptability, most B cells activated in the elderly cohort target highly conserved but less potent epitopes. Given these findings, vaccines driving immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation should be a priority to protect elderly individuals.},

One challenge in integrating these molecular data is the identification of aberrant protein products from mass-spectrometry (MS) datasets, as traditional proteomic analyses only identify proteins from a reference sequence database. We established proteomic workflows to detect peptide variants within MS datasets. We used a combination of publicly available population variants (dbSNP and UniProt) and somatic variations in cancer (COSMIC) along with sample-specific genomic and transcriptomic data to examine proteome variation within and across 59 cancer cell-lines. We developed a set of recommendations for the detection of variants using three search algorithms, a split target-decoy approach for FDR estimation, and multiple post-search filters. We examined 7.3 million unique variant tryptic peptides not found within any reference proteome and identified 4771 mutations corresponding to somatic and germline deviations from reference proteomes in 2200 genes among the NCI60 cell-line proteomes. We discuss in detail the technical and computational challenges in identifying variant peptides by MS and show that uncovering these variants allows the identification of druggable mutations within important cancer genes.},

abstract = {Immunotherapy is becoming increasingly important in the fight against cancers, using and manipulating the body's immune response to treat tumors. Understanding the immune repertoire-the collection of immunological proteins-of treated and untreated cells is possible at the genomic, but technically difficult at the protein level. Standard protein databases do not include the highly divergent sequences of somatic rearranged immunoglobulin genes, and may lead to miss identifications in a mass spectrometry search. We introduce a novel proteogenomic approach, AbScan, to identify these highly variable antibody peptides, by developing a customized antibody database construction method using RNA-seq reads aligned to immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. AbScan starts by filtering transcript (RNA-seq) reads that match the template for Ig genes. The retained reads are used to construct a repertoire graph using the "split" de Bruijn graph: A graph structure that improves on the standard de Bruijn graph to capture the high diversity of Ig genes in a compact manner. AbScan corrects for sequencing errors, and converts the graph to a format suitable for searching with MS/MS search tools. We used AbScan to create an antibody database from 90 RNA-seq colorectal tumor samples. Next, we used proteogenomic analysis to search MS/MS spectra of matched colorectal samples from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) against the AbScan generated database. AbScan identified 1,940 distinct antibody peptides. Correlating with previously identified Single Amino-Acid Variants (SAAVs) in the tumor samples, we identified 163 pairs (antibody peptide, SAAV) with significant cooccurrence pattern in the 90 samples. The presence of coexpressed antibody and mutated peptides was correlated with survival time of the individuals. Our results suggest that AbScan (https://github.com/csw407/AbScan.git) is an effective tool for a proteomic exploration of the immune response in cancers.},

Antibody glycosylation on the Fab and Fc portion is known to influence antigen binding and effector functions, respectively. To study associations between antibody glycosylation profiles and (patho) physiological states as well as antibody functionality, advanced technologies and methods are required. In-depth structural characterization of antibody glycosylation usually relies on the separation and tandem mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of released glycans. Protein- and site-specific information, on the other hand, may be obtained by the MS analysis of glycopeptides. With the development of high-resolution mass spectrometers, antibody glycosylation analysis at the intact or middle-up level has gained more interest, providing an integrated view of different post-translational modifications (including glycosylation). Alongside the in-depth methods, there is also great interest in robust, high-throughput techniques for routine glycosylation profiling in biopharma and clinical laboratories. With an emphasis on IgG Fc glycosylation, several highly robust separation-based techniques are employed for this purpose. In this review, we describe recent advances in MS methods, separation techniques and orthogonal approaches for the characterization of immunoglobulin glycosylation in different settings. We put emphasis on the current status and expected developments of antibody glycosylation analysis in biomedical, biopharmaceutical and clinical research.},

De novo sequencing is considerably harder, but critical when sequence databases are incomplete or not available. In this paper we build upon earlier work due to Dancik et al., and Chen et al. to provide a dynamic programming algorithm for interpreting de novo spectra. Our method can handle most of the commonly occurring ions, including a, b, y, and their neutral losses. Additionally, we shift the emphasis away from sequencing to assigning ion types to peaks. In particular, we introduce the notion of core interpretations, which allow us to give confidence values to individual peak assignments, even in the absence of a strong interpretation. Finally, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluating de novo algorithms as a function of spectral quality. We show that our algorithm, in particular the core-interpretation, is robust in the presence of measurement error, and low fragmentation probability.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to the identification of mass spectrometrically fragmented peptides. A fragmentation spectrum usually contains a short, easily identifiable series of sequence ions, which yields a partial sequence. This partial sequence divides the peptide into three parts-regions 1, 2, and 3-characterized by the added mass m1 of region 1, the partial sequence of region 2, and the added mass m3 of region 3. We call the construct, m1 partial sequence m3, a "peptide sequence tag" and show that it is a highly specific identifier of the peptide. An algorithm developed here that uses the sequence tag to find the peptide in a sequence database is up to 1 million-fold more discriminating than the partial sequence information alone. Peptides can be identified even in the presence of an unknown posttranslational modification or an amino acid substitution between an entry in the sequence database and the measured peptide. These concepts are demonstrated with model and practical examples of electrospray mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. Just two to three amino acid residues derived by fragmentation are enough to identify these peptides. In peptide mapping applications, even less information is necessary.},

Different strategies of protein and chemical engineering, including humanization techniques of non-human antibodies were applied successfully to optimize clinical performances of antibodies. Despite the emergence of techniques allowing the development of fully human antibodies such as transgenic Xeno-mice, antibody humanization remains a standard procedure for therapeutic antibodies. An important prerequisite for antibody humanization requires standardized numbering methods to define precisely complementary determining regions (CDR), frameworks and residues from the light and heavy chains that affect the binding affinity and/or specificity of the antibody-antigen interaction. The recently generated deep-sequencing data and the increasing number of solved three-dimensional structures of antibodies from human and non-human origins have led to the emergence of numerous databases. However, these different databases use different numbering conventions and CDR definitions. In addition, the large fluctuation of the variable chain lengths, especially in CDR3 of heavy chains (CDRH3), hardly complicates the comparison and analysis of antibody sequences and the identification of the antigen binding residues. This review compares and discusses the different numbering schemes and "CDR" definition that were established up to date. Furthermore, it summarizes concepts and strategies used for numbering residues of antibodies and CDR residues identification. Finally, it discusses the importance of specific sets of residues in the binding affinity and/or specificity of immunoglobulins.},

Here, we describe the results obtained analyzing a monoclonal IgG1, either in its ∼150 kDa intact form or after highly specific digestions yielding ∼25 and ∼50 kDa subunits, using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer on a liquid chromatography (LC) time scale with fragmentation from ion-photon, ion-ion, and ion-neutral interactions. Ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) used a new 213 nm solid-state laser. Alternatively, we applied high-capacity electron-transfer dissociation (ETD HD), alone or in combination with higher energy collisional dissociation (EThcD). Notably, we verify the degree of complementarity of these ion activation methods, with the combination of 213 nm UVPD and ETD HD producing a new record sequence coverage of ∼40{\%} for TD MS experiments. The addition of EThcD for the {\textgreater}25 kDa products from MD strategies generated up to 90{\%} of complete sequence information in six LC runs. Importantly, we determined an optimal signal-to-noise threshold for fragment ion deconvolution to suppress false positives yet maximize sequence coverage and implemented a systematic validation of this process using the new software TDValidator. This rigorous data analysis should elevate confidence for assignment of dense MS2 spectra and represents a purposeful step toward the application of TD and MD MS for deep sequencing of monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, native mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a valuable tool to study intact proteins and noncovalent protein complexes. Studied experimental systems range from small-molecule (drug)-protein interactions, to nanomachineries such as the proteasome and ribosome, to even virus assembly. In native MS, ions attain high m/z values, requiring special mass analyzers for their detection. Depending on the particular mass analyzer used, instrumental mass resolution does often decrease at higher m/z but can still be above a couple of thousand at m/z 5000. However, the mass resolving power obtained on charge states of protein complexes in this m/z region is experimentally found to remain well below the inherent instrument resolution of the mass analyzers employed. Here, we inquire into reasons for this discrepancy and ask how native MS would benefit from higher instrumental mass resolution. To answer this question, we discuss advantages and shortcomings of mass analyzers used to study intact biomolecules and biomolecular complexes in their native state, and we review which other factors determine mass resolving power in native MS analyses. Recent examples from the literature are given to illustrate the current status and limitations. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] {\textcopyright}2014 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

Thus, monitoring in vivo PTM changes of mAbs helps evaluate the criticality of PQAs during the product risk assessment. In addition, quantitation of the subject exposures to PTM variants helps assess the impact of PTMs on the safety and efficacy of therapeutic mAbs. Here, we developed an immunocapture-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method to quantify in vivo PTM changes a therapeutic mAb overtime in single- and multiple-dose monkey pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. We also built mathematical models to predict the in vivo serum concentrations of PQAs, the subject exposures to PQAs, and the relative abundance of PQAs in single- and multipledose regimens. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results.

Recent applications include the study of autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As sequencing technologies continue to improve, these repertoire sequencing experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of sequences. These data require specialized bioinformatics pipelines to be analyzed effectively. Numerous methods and tools have been developed to handle different steps of the analysis, and integrated software suites have recently been made available. However, the field has yet to converge on a standard pipeline for data processing and analysis. Common file formats for data sharing are also lacking. Here we provide a set of practical guidelines for B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing analysis, starting from raw sequencing reads and proceeding through pre-processing, determination of population structure, and analysis of repertoire properties. These include methods for unique molecular identifiers and sequencing error correction, V(D)J assignment and detection of novel alleles, clonal assignment, lineage tree construction, somatic hypermutation modeling, selection analysis, and analysis of stereotyped or convergent responses. The guidelines presented here highlight the major steps involved in the analysis of B-cell repertoire sequencing data, along with recommendations on how to avoid common pitfalls.},

abstract = {Antibody repertoire diversity, potentially as high as 1011 unique molecules in a single individual, confounds characterization by conventional sequence analyses. In this study, we present a general method for assessing human antibody sequence diversity displayed on phage using massively parallel pyrosequencing, a novel application of Kabat column-labeled profile Hidden Markov Models, and translated complementarity determining region (CDR) capture-recapture analysis. Pyrosequencing of domain amplicon and RCA PCR products generated 1.5 × 106 reads, including more than 1.9 × 105 high quality, full-length sequences of antibody variable fragment (Fv) variable domains. Novel methods for germline and CDR classification and fine characterization of sequence diversity in the 6 CDRs are presented. Diverse germline contributions to the repertoire with random heavy and light chain pairing are observed. All germline families were found to be represented in 1.7 × 104 sequences obtained from repeated panning of the library. While the most variable CDR (CDR-H3) presents significant length and sequence variability, we find a substantial contribution to total diversity from somatically mutated germline encoded CDRs 1 and 2. Using a capture-recapture method, the total diversity of the antibody library obtained from a human donor Immunoglobulin M (IgM) pool was determined to be at least 3.5 × 1010. The results provide insights into the role of IgM diversification, display library construction, and productive germline usages in antibody libraries and the humoral repertoire.},

abstract = {The global antibody market has grown exponentially due to increasing applications in research, diagnostics and therapy. Antibodies are present in complex matrices (e.g. serum, milk, egg yolk, fermentation broth or plant-derived extracts). This has led to the need for development of novel platforms for purification of large quantities of antibody with defined clinical and performance requirements. However, the choice of method is strictly limited by the manufacturing cost and the quality of the end product required. Affinity chromatography is one of the most extensively used methods for antibody purification, due to its high selectivity and rapidity. Its effectiveness is largely based on the binding characteristics of the required antibody and the ligand used for antibody capture. The approaches used for antibody purification are critically examined with the aim of providing the reader with the principles and practical insights required to understand the intricacies of the procedures. Affinity support matrices and ligands for affinity chromatography are discussed, including their relevant underlying principles of use, their potential value and their performance in purifying different types of antibodies, along with a list of commercially available alternatives. Furthermore, the principal factors influencing purification procedures at various stages are highlighted. Practical considerations for development and/or optimizations of efficient antibody-purification protocols are suggested. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Detecting autoimmune diseases at an early stage is crucial for effective treatment and disease management to slow disease progression and prevent irreversible organ damage. In many autoimmune diseases, disease-specific autoantibodies are produced by B cells in response to soluble autoantigens due to defects in B cell tolerance mechanisms. Autoantibodies accrue early in disease development, and several are so disease-specific they serve as classification criteria. In this study, we established a high-throughput, sensitive, intact serum autoantibody analysis platform based on the optimization of a one dimensional ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography top-down mass spectrometry platform (1D UPLC-TDMS). This approach has been successfully applied to a 12 standard monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) mixture, demonstrating the feasibility to separate and sequence intact antibodies with high sequence coverage and high sensitivity. We then applied the optimized platform to characterize total serum antibody Fabs in a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient sample and compared it to healthy control samples. From this analysis, we show that the SLE sample has many dominant antibody Fab-related mass features unlike the healthy controls. To our knowledge, this is the first top-down demonstration of serum autoantibody pool analysis. Our proposed approach holds great promise for discovering novel serum autoantibody biomarkers that are of interest for diagnosis, prognosis, and tolerance induction, as well as improving our understanding of pathogenic autoimmune processes.},

abstract = {In proteomics, de novo sequencing is the process of deriving peptide sequences from tandem mass spectra without the assistance of a sequence database. Such analyses have traditionally been performed manually by human experts, and more recently by computer programs that have been developed because of the need for higher throughput. Although powerful, de novo sequencing often can only determine partially correct sequence tags because of imperfect tandem mass spectra. However, these sequence tags can then be searched in a sequence database to identify the exact or a homologous peptide. Homology searches are particularly useful for the study of organisms whose genomes have not been sequenced. This tutorial will present background important to understanding de novo sequencing, suggestions on how to do this manually, plus descriptions of computer algorithms used to automate this process and to subsequently carryout homology-based database searches.

abstract = {De novo sequencing software has been widely used in proteomics to sequence new peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data. This study presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000 spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and incorpo- rated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets, Novor sequenced 7{\%}–37{\%} more correct residues than the state-of-the-art de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude faster. Novor can de novo sequencemore than 300MS/MSspectra per second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed of today'smass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a newpossibility to de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the spectral data.},

abstract = {Three clinically relevant ebolaviruses – Ebola (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Sudan (SUDV) viruses, are responsible for severe disease and occasional deadly outbreaks in Africa. The largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic to date in 2013-2016 in West Africa highlighted the urgent need for countermeasures, leading to the development and FDA approval of the Ebola virus vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo {\textregistered}) in 2020 and two monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics (Inmazeb {\textregistered}[atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn] and Ebanga {\textregistered}(ansuvimab-zykl) in 2020. The humoral response plays an indispensable role in ebolavirus immunity, based on studies of mAbs isolated from the antibody genes in peripheral blood circulating ebolavirus-specific human memory B cells. However, antibodies in the body are not secreted by circulating memory B cells in the blood but rather principally by plasma cells in the bone marrow. Little is known about the protective polyclonal antibody responses in convalescent plasma. Here we exploited both single-cell antibody gene sequencing and proteomic sequencing approaches to assess the composition of the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP)-reactive antibody repertoire in the plasma of an EVD survivor. We first identified 1,512 GP-specific mAb variable gene sequences from single cells in the memory B cell compartment. Using mass spectrometric analysis of the corresponding GP-specific plasma IgG, we found that only a portion of the large B cell antibody repertoire was represented in the plasma. Molecular and functional analysis of proteomics-identified mAbs revealed recognition of epitopes in three major antigenic sites - the GP head domain, the glycan cap, and the base region, with a high prevalence of neutralizing and protective mAb specificities that targeted the base and glycan cap regions on the GP. Polyclonal plasma antibodies from the survivor reacted broadly to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP, while reactivity of the potently neutralizing mAbs we identified was limited mostly to the homologous EBOV GP. Together these results reveal a restricted diversity of neutralizing humoral response in which mAbs targeting two antigenic sites on GP – glycan cap and base – play a principal role in plasma-antibody-mediated protective immunity against EVD.},

The improved spectral quality enables more accurate de novo sequencing for identification of post-translational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms. Results: In this study, a new de novo sequencing algorithm, called Vonode, has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. To fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra, a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions. Consensus sequence tags were inferred for 11,422 spectra with an average peptide length of 5.5 residues from a total of 40,297 input spectra acquired in a 24-hour proteomics measurement of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The accuracy of inferred consensus sequence tags was 84{\%}. According to our comparison, the performance of Vonode was shown to be superior to the PepNovo v2.0 algorithm, in terms of the number of de novo sequenced spectra and the sequencing accuracy. Conclusions: Here, we improved de novo sequencing performance by developing a new algorithm specifically for high-resolution tandem mass spectral data.

abstract = {Post-translational modifications can have a signification effect on antibody stability. A comprehensive approach is often required to best understand the underlying reasons the modification affects the antibody's potency or aggregation state. Monoclonal antibody 001 displayed significant variation in terms of potency, as defined by surface plasmon resonance testing (Biacore), from lot to lot independent of any observable aggregation or degradation, suggesting that a post-translational modification could be driving this variability. Analysis of different antibody lots using analytical hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) uncovered multiple peaks of varying size. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) indicated that the antibody contained a cysteinylation post-translational modification in complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 of the antibody light chain. Fractionation of the antibody by HIC followed by ESI-MS and Biacore showed that the different peaks were antibody containing zero, one, or two cysteinylation modifications, and that the modification interferes with the ability of the modified antibody arm to bind antigen. Molecular modeling of the modified region shows that this oxidation of an unpaired cysteine in the antibody CDR would block a potential antigen binding pocket, suggesting an inhibition mechanism.},

abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. Findings: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5{\textperiodcentered}2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4{\textperiodcentered}1–7{\textperiodcentered}0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0{\textperiodcentered}15, 95{\%} CI −0{\textperiodcentered}19 to −0{\textperiodcentered}11; R2=0{\textperiodcentered}71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's {\$}\rho{\$}=0{\textperiodcentered}48, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}074–0{\textperiodcentered}75; p=0{\textperiodcentered}020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94{\%} for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88{\%} for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100{\%} for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94{\%} for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2{\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. Interpretation: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

abstract = {The characterization of proteomes by mass spectrometry is largely limited to organisms with sequenced genomes. To identify proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes, database sequences from related species must be employed for sequence-similarity protein identifications. Peptide sequence tags (Mann, 1994) have been used successfully for the identification of proteins in sequence databases using partially interpreted tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides. We have extended the ability of sequence tag searching to the identification of proteins whose sequences are yet unknown but are homologous to known database entries. The MultiTag method presented here assigns statistical significance to matches of multiple error-tolerant sequence tags to a database entry and ranks alignments by their significance. The MultiTag approach has the distinct advantage over other sequence-similarity approaches of being able to perform sequence-similarity identifications using only very short (2-4) amino acid residue stretches of peptide sequences, rather than complete peptide sequences deduced by de novo interpretation of tandem mass spectra. This feature facilitates the identification of low abundance proteins, since noisy and low-intensity tandem mass spectra can be utilized.},

abstract = {Background: IdeS, a proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes, cleaves Immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies with a unique degree of specificity. Pathogenic IgG antibodies constitute an important clinical problem contributing to the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune conditions and acute transplant rejection. To be able to effectively remove such antibodies is therefore an important clinical challenge. Methodology/Principal Findings: IdeS was found to specifically and efficiently cleave IgG in human blood in vitro (20 {\$}\mu{\$}g of IdeS caused a complete degradation of IgG in one ml of human whole blood in 15 minutes) and to clear IgG from the blood stream of rabbits in vivo (no IgG was detected six hours following an intravenous injection of 5 mg of IdeS) without any side effects. In a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), polyclonal IgG antibodies against platelet surface antigens were used to induce a lethal disease. These profoundly thrombocytopenic animals were treated and cured by a single injection of IdeS. Conclusions/Significance: Novel information is provided concerning the IgG-cleaving activity of IdeS in vitro and in vivo. The highly specific and rapid elimination of IgG in vivo, the dramatic effect in a mouse model of ITP, and the lack of side effects in the treated animals, indicate that IdeS could also be used to treat IgG-driven diseases in humans.

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a disruptive technology that has found widespread acceptance in the life sciences research community. The high throughput and low cost of sequencing has encouraged researchers to undertake ambitious genomic projects, especially in de novo genome sequencing. Currently, NGS systems generate sequence data as short reads and de novo genome assembly using these short reads is computationally very intensive. Due to lower cost of sequencing and higher throughput, NGS systems now provide the ability to sequence genomes at high depth. However, currently no report is available highlighting the impact of high sequence depth on genome assembly using real data sets and multiple assembly algorithms. Recently, some studies have evaluated the impact of sequence coverage, error rate and average read length on genome assembly using multiple assembly algorithms, however, these evaluations were performed using simulated datasets. One limitation of using simulated datasets is that variables such as error rates, read length and coverage which are known to impact genome assembly are carefully controlled. Hence, this study was undertaken to identify the minimum depth of sequencing required for de novo assembly for different sized genomes using graph based assembly algorithms and real datasets. Illumina reads for E.coli (4.6 MB) S.kudriavzevii (11.18 MB) and C.elegans (100 MB) were assembled using SOAPdenovo, Velvet, ABySS, Meraculous and IDBA-UD. Our analysis shows that 50X is the optimum read depth for assembling these genomes using all assemblers except Meraculous which requires 100X read depth. Moreover, our analysis shows that de novo assembly from 50X read data requires only 6-40 GB RAM depending on the genome size and assembly algorithm used. We believe that this information can be extremely valuable for researchers in designing experiments and multiplexing which will enable optimum utilization of sequencing as well as analysis resources.},

abstract = {The increasing importance of immunoglobulins G (IgGs) as biotherapeutics calls for improved structural characterization methods designed for these large ({\~{}}150kDa) macromolecules. Analysis workflows have to be rapid, robust, and require minimal sample preparation. In a previous work we showed the potential of Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) combined with electron transfer dissociation (ETD) for the top-down investigation of an intact IgG1, resulting in {\~{}}30{\%} sequence coverage. Here, we describe a top-down analysis of two IgGs1 (adalimumab and trastuzumab) and one IgG2 (panitumumab) performed with ETD on a mass spectrometer equipped with a high-field Orbitrap mass analyzer. For the IgGs1, sequence coverage comparable to the previous results was achieved in a two-fold reduced number of summed transients, which corresponds, taken together with the significantly increased spectra acquisition rate, to {\~{}}six-fold improvement in analysis time. Furthermore, we studied the influence of ion-ion interaction times on ETD product ions for IgGs1, and the differences in fragmentation behavior between IgGs1 and IgG2, which present structural differences. Overall, these results reinforce the hypothesis that gas phase dissociation using both energy threshold-based and radical-driven ion activations is directed to specific regions of the polypeptide chains mostly by the location of disulfide bonds. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY Compared with our previous report, the results presented herein demonstrate the power of technological advances of the next generation Orbitrap™ platform, including the use of a high-field compact (i.e., D20) Orbitrap mass analyzer, and a dedicated manipulation strategy for large protein ions (via their trapping in the HCD collision cell along with reduction of the pressure in the cell). Notably, these important developments became recently commercially available in the top-end Orbitrap platforms under the name of "Protein Mode". Furthermore, we continued exploring the advantages offered by the summation (averaging) of transients (time-domain data) for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of top-down mass spectra. Finally, for the first time we report the application of the hybrid ion activation technique that combines electron transfer dissociation and higher energy collisional dissociation, known as EThcD, on intact monoclonal antibodies. Under these specific instrumental parameters, EThcD produces a partially complementary fragmentation pattern compared to ETD, increasing the overall sequence coverage especially at the protein termini.},

Polypeptides of 1600 Daltons (Da) or more can be sequenced effectively through exhaustive compositional analysis of MS/MS spectra obtained by unimolecular decomposition (without CID) in a MALDI TOF/ TOF despite a fragment mass accuracy of 50 mDa. Peaks are referenced against the lookup table to obtain a complete profile of amino acid combinations, and combinations are assembled into series of increasing length. Concatenating the differences between successive entries in compositional series yields peptide sequences that can be scored and ranked according to signal intensity.

abstract = {A hallmark of B-cell immunity is the generation of a diverse repertoire of antibodies from a limited set of germline V(D)J genes. This repertoire is usually defined in terms of amino acid composition. However, variable domains may also acquire N-linked glycans, a process conditional on the introduction of consensus amino acid motifs (N-glycosylation sites) during somatic hypermutation. High levels of variable domain glycans have been associated with autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, as well as certain follicular lymphomas. However, the role of these glycans in the humoral immune response remains poorly understood. Interestingly, studies have reported both positive and negative effects on antibody affinity. Our aim was to elucidate the role of variable domain glycans during antigen-specific antibody responses. By analyzing B-cell repertoires by next-generation sequencing, we demonstrate that N-glycosylation sites are introduced at positions in which glycans can affect antigen binding as a result of a specific clustering of progenitor glycosylation sites in the germline sequences of variable domain genes. By analyzing multiple human monoclonal and polyclonal (auto)antibody responses, we subsequently show that this process is subject to selection during antigen-specific antibody responses, skewed toward IgG4, and positively contributes to antigen binding. Together, these results highlight a physiological role for variable domain glycosylation as an additional layer of antibody diversification that modulates antigen binding.},

The anti-CA09 HA polyclonal response in this donor comprised 24 persistent antibody clonotypes, accounting for 72.6{\%} ± 10.0{\%} of the anti-CA09 HA repertoire over 5 years. These persistent antibodies displayed higher somatic hypermutation relative to transient serum antibodies detected at one time point. Additionally, persistent antibodies predominantly demonstrated cross-reactivity and potent neutralization toward a phylogenetically distant H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VT04) strain, a feature correlated with HA stem recognition.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, American Society for Mass Spectrometry. Analysis of whole proteins by mass spectrometry, or top-down proteomics, has several advantages over methods relying on proteolysis. For example, proteoforms can be unambiguously identified and examined. However , from a gas-phase ion-chemistry perspective, proteins are enormous molecules that present novel challenges relative to peptide analysis. Herein, the statistics of cleaving the peptide backbone multiple times are examined to evaluate the inherent propensity for generating internal versus terminal ions. The raw statistics reveal an inherent bias favoring production of terminal ions, which holds true regardless of protein size. Importantly, even if the full suite of internal ions is generated by statistical dissociation, terminal ions are predicted to account for at least 50{\%} of the total ion current, regardless of protein size, if there are three backbone dissociations or fewer. Top-down analysis should therefore be a viable approach for examining proteins of significant size. Comparison of the purely statistical analysis with actual top-down data derived from ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) reveals that terminal ions account for much of the total ion current in both experiments. Terminal ion production is more favored in UVPD relative to HCD, which is likely due to differences in the mechanisms controlling fragmentation. Importantly, internal ions are not found to dominate from either the theoretical or experimental point of view. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {Although incredibly diverse in specificity, millions of unique Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules in the human antibody repertoire share most of their amino acid sequence. These constant parts of IgG do not yield any useful information in attempts to sequence antibodies de novo. Therefore, methods focusing solely on the variable regions and providing unambiguous sequence reads are strongly advantageous. We report a mass spectrometry-based method that uses electron capture dissociation (ECD) to provide straightforward-to-read sequence ladders for the variable parts of both the light and heavy chains, with a preference for the functionally important CDR3. We optimized this method on the therapeutic antibody Trastuzumab and demonstrate its applicability on two monoclonal quartets of the four IgG subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. The method is based on proteolytically separating the variable F(ab')2 part from the conserved Fc part, whereafter the F(ab')2 portions are mass-analyzed and fragmented by ECD. Pure ECD, without additional collisional activation, leads to straightforward-to-read sequence tags covering the CDR3 of both the light and heavy chains. Using molecular modelling and structural analysis, we discuss and explain this selective fragmentation behavior and describe how structural features of the different IgG subclasses lead to distinct fragmentation patterns. Overall, we foresee that pure ECD on F(ab')2 or Fab molecules can become a valuable tool for the de novo sequencing of serum antibodies.},

abstract = {A comparative in vitro survey of physiologically relevant human and microbial proteinases defined a number of enzymes that induced specific hinge domain cleavage in human IgG1. Several of these proteinases have been associated with tumor growth, inflammation, and infection. A majority of the identified proteinases converted IgG to F(ab′)2, and a consistent feature of their action was a transient accumulation of a single-cleaved intermediate (scIgG). The scIgG resulted from the relatively rapid cleavage of the first hinge domain heavy chain, followed by a slower cleavage of the second chain to separate the Fc domain from F(ab′)2. Major sites of enzymatic cleavage were identified or confirmed from the mass of the F(ab′)2 or Fab fragments and/or the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the Fc for each enzyme including human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 3 and 12, human cathepsin G, human neutrophil elastase (Fab), staphylococcal glutamyl endopeptidase I and streptococcal immunoglobulin-degrading enzyme (IdeS). The cleavage sites in IgG1 by MMP-3, cathepsin G and IdeS were used to guide the synthesis of peptide analogs containing the corresponding carboxy-termini to be used as immunogens in rabbits. Rabbit antibodies were successfully generated that showed selective binding to different human F(ab′)2s and other hinge-cleavage fragments, but not to intact IgG. In Western blotting studies of synovial fluids from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, the rabbit antibodies yielded patterns consistent with the presence of endogenous IgG fragments including F(ab′)2 and the single-cleaved IgG intermediate. The detection in synovial fluid of IgG fragments similar to those observed in the in vitro biochemical studies suggests that proteolysis of IgG may contribute to localized immune dysfunction in inflammatory environments. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

On the molecular level, MCL is characterized by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in juxtaposition of the bcl-1 locus on 11q13 to the immunoglobuLin heavy chain gene region, resulting in deregulation of CCND1/PRAD1, the gene encoding the cell cycle protein cycLin D1. The inappropriate expression of cycLin D1 protein is the diagnostic hallmark of this lymphoma and is considered the first step in its pathogenesis, although it is not sufficient for full maLignant transformation and requires additional molecular alterations mostly affecting cell cycle regulation or DNA damage response to cause manifest disease. Recently, a rare, cycLin D1-negative variant of MCL with otherwise identical cLinical, morphological, and phenotypic features has been identified, in the majority of the cases characterized by translocations involving CCND2/cycLin D2.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new human disease with few effective treatments1. Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses2,3. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed1,2. This retrospective, propensity score–matched case–control study assessed the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in 39 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Oxygen requirements on day 14 after transfusion worsened in 17.9{\%} of plasma recipients versus 28.2{\%} of propensity score–matched controls who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.75–0.98; chi-square test P value = 0.025). Survival also improved in plasma recipients (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.34; 95{\%} CI, 0.13–0.89; chi-square test P = 0.027). Convalescent plasma is potentially effective against COVID-19, but adequately powered, randomized controlled trials are needed.},

Initial attempts to use monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics were hampered, however, by the potent immunogenicity of mouse (and other rodent) antibodies in humans. Humanization technology has made it possible to remove the immunogenicity associated with the use of rodent antibodies, or at least to reduce it to an acceptable level for clinical use in humans, thus facilitating the application of monoclonal antibodies to the treatment of human disease. To date, nine humanized monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use as human therapeutics in the United States. In this paper, we describe procedures for antibody humanization with an emphasis on strategies for designing humanized antibodies with the aid of computer-guided modeling of antibody variable domains, using as an example the humanized anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, Zenapax. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this approach, relationships between m/z peaks are represented by attractive and repulsive springs, and the vibrational modes of the spring system are used to infer information about the peaks (such as "likely b-ion" or "likely y-ion"). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparison with other de novo sequencers on test sets of ion-trap and QTOF spectra, including spectra of mixtures of peptides. On all datasets, we outperform the other sequencers. Along with spectral graph theory techniques, the new de novo sequencer EigenMS incorporates another improvement of independent interest: robust statistical methods for recalibration of time-of-flight mass measurements. Robust recalibration greatly outperforms simple least-squares recalibration, achieving about three times the accuracy for one QTOF dataset.},

Here we used high-resolution proteomics analysis of immunoglobulin (referred to as Ig-seq) coupled with high-throughput sequencing of transcripts encoding B cell receptors (BCR-seq) to quantitatively determine the antibody repertoire at the individual clonotype level in the sera of young adults before and after vaccination with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The serum repertoire comprised between 40 and 147 clonotypes that were specific to each of the three monovalent components of the trivalent influenza vaccine, with boosted pre-existing clonotypes accounting for {\^{a}} 1/460{\%} of the response. An unexpectedly high fraction of serum antibodies recognized both the H1 and H3 monovalent vaccines. Recombinant versions of these H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad binding to hemagglutinins (HAs) from previously circulating virus strains; several of these antibodies, which were prevalent in the serum of multiple donors, recognized the same conserved epitope in the HA head domain. Although the HA-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show neutralization activity in vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains when administered before or after challenge. Collectively, our data reveal unanticipated insights regarding the serological response to influenza vaccination and raise questions about the added benefits of using a quadrivalent vaccine instead of a trivalent vaccine.},

To understand how such broadly neutralizing antibodies develop, we used x-ray crystallography and 454 pyrosequencing to characterize additional VRC01-like antibodies from HIV-1-infected individuals. Crystal structures revealed a convergent mode of binding for diverse antibodies to the same CD4-binding-site epitope. A functional genomics analysis of expressed heavy and light chains revealed common pathways of antibody-heavy chain maturation, confined to the IGHV1-2*02 lineage, involving dozens of somatic changes, and capable of pairing with different light chains. Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 immunity associated with VRC01-like antibodies thus involves the evolution of antibodies to a highly affinity-matured state required to recognize an invariant viral structure, with lineages defined from thousands of sequences providing a genetic roadmap of their development.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses sequencing of peptides by tandem mass spectrometry and high-energy collision-induced dissociation. To ionize large polar molecules, such as peptides of a size encountered in the study of various aspects of protein structure, methods are used that impart little excess energy on the molecule. Furthermore, most of these “soft” ionization techniques produce the charged particle by addition or removal of a proton to form the very stable, even-electron ions (M + H)+ or (M - H)-, that have little tendency to fragment. The first demonstration of the generation of large protonated peptides involved fast atom bombardment (FAB), but the data and methodology discussed in this chapter utilize either Xe ° or Cs+ as primary particles. Peptides derived from proteins are linear molecules (at least after reduction of any disulfide bridges originally present) that consist of repeating units having an identical backbone, –NH–CH(R)–CO–, but differing in the nature of the side chain, R. There are only 20 different amino acids that occur in proteins (and are defined by the genetic code), in addition to the occasional occurrence of others formed by posttranslational processes. {\textcopyright}1990, Elsevier Inc.

Many recent studies of antibodies focus on the population of antibody transcripts that show which V, D, and J gene segments have been favored for a particular antigen, a repertoire. To properly describe the antibody repertoire, each antibody must be labeled by its constituting V, D, and J gene segment, a task made difficult by somatic recombination and hypermutation events. While previous approaches to repertoire analysis were based on sequential alignments, we describe a new de Bruijn graph-based algorithm to perform VDJ labeling and benchmark its performance.},

abstract = {The murine monoclonal antibody mumAb4D5, directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (p185HER2), specifically inhibits proliferation of human tumor cells overexpressing p185HER2. However, the efficacy of mumAb4D5 in human cancer therapy is likely to be limited by a human anti-mouse antibody response and lack of effector functions. A "humanized" antibody, humAb4D5-1, containing only the antigen binding loops from mumAb4D5 and human variable region framework residues plus IgG1 constant domains was constructed. Light- and heavy-chain variable regions were simultaneously humanized in one step by "gene conversion mutagenesis" using 311-mer and 361-mer preassembled oligonucleotides, respectively. The humAb4D5-1 variant does not block the proliferation of human breast carcinoma SK-BR-3 cells, which overexpress p185HER2, despite tight antigen binding (Kd = 25 nM). One of seven additional humanized variants designed by molecular modeling (humAb4D5-8) binds the p185HER2 antigen 250-fold and 3-fold more tightly than humAb4D5-1 and mumAb4D5, respectively. In addition, humAb4D5-8 has potency comparable to the murine antibody in blocking SK-BR-3 cell proliferation. Furthermore, humAb4D5-8 is much more efficient in supporting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SK-BR-3 cells than mumAb4D5, but it does not efficiently kill WI-38 cells, which express p185HER2 at lower levels.},

Each amino acid was identified from the mass difference between successive peaks, and the position in the data set defined the sequence of the original peptide chain.

However, due to limitations in peptides fragmentation and coverage, as well as ambiguities in spectra interpretation, complete de novo assembly of unknown protein sequences still remains challenging. To address this problem, we propose an integrated system, ALPS, which for the first time can automatically assemble full-length monoclonal antibody sequences. Our system integrates de novo sequencing peptides, their quality scores and error-correction information from databases into a weighted de Bruijn graph to assemble protein sequences. We evaluated ALPS performance on two antibody data sets, each including a heavy chain and a light chain. The results show that ALPS was able to assemble three complete monoclonal antibody sequences of length 216-441 AA, at 100{\%} coverage, and 96.64-100{\%} accuracy.},

To meet the needs of the rapidly growing therapeutic antibody market, it is important to develop analytical strategies to characterize the heterogeneity of a therapeutic product's primary structure accurately and reproducibly. The major objective of the present study is to determine whether current TD/MD MS technologies and protocols can add value to the more commonly employed bottom-up (BU) approaches with regard to confirming protein integrity, sequencing variable domains, avoiding artifacts, and revealing modifications and their locations. We also aim to gather information on the common TD/MD MS methods and practices in the field. A panel of three mAbs was selected and centrally provided to 20 laboratories worldwide for the analysis: Sigma mAb standard (SiLuLite), NIST mAb standard, and the therapeutic mAb Herceptin (trastuzumab). Various MS instrument platforms and ion dissociation techniques were employed. The present study confirms that TD/MD MS tools are available in laboratories worldwide and provide complementary information to the BU approach that can be crucial for comprehensive mAb characterization. The current limitations, as well as possible solutions to overcome them, are also outlined. A primary limitation revealed by the results of the present study is that the expert knowledge in both experiment and data analysis is indispensable to practice TD/MD MS.},

Although SEQUEST and Mascot perform a conceptually similar task to the tool BLAST, the key algorithmic idea of BLAST (filtration) was never implemented in these tools. As a result MS/MS protein identification tools are becoming too time-consuming for many applications including search for post-translationally modified peptides. Moreover, matching millions of spectra against all known proteins will soon make these tools too slow in the same way that "genome vs genome" comparisons instantly made BLAST too slow. We describe the development of filters for MS/MS database searches that dramatically reduce the running time and effectively remove the bottlenecks in searching the huge space of protein modifications.

Traditional methods that sequence spectra individually are limited by short peptide length, incomplete peptide fragmentation, and ambiguous de novo interpretations. We address these issues by determining consensus sequences for assembled tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra from overlapping peptides (e.g., by using multiple enzymatic digests). We have combined electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation methods to boost interpretation of long, highly charged peptides and take advantage of corroborating b/y/c/z ions in CID/HCD/ETD. Using these strategies, we show that triplet CID/HCD/ETD MS/MS spectra from overlapping peptides yield de novo sequences of average length 70 AA and as long as 200 AA at up to 99{\%} sequencing accuracy.},

A key feature of the antibody-combining site is the protruding, finger-like long CDR H3 that can penetrate the recessed CD4-binding site of gp120. A docking model of b12 and gp120 reveals severe structural constraints that explain the extraordinary challenge in eliciting effective neutralizing antibodies similar to b12.

It was determined that employing mobile phases containing acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, and formic acid allowed the separation of antibody light chain and heavy chain after reduction by SEC. In addition, this mobile phase allowed the coupling of SEC to a mass spectrometer to obtain a direct molecular weight measurement. The application of the SEC-MS method was demonstrated by the separation of the light chain and the heavy chain of multiple recombinant monoclonal antibodies. In addition, separation of a thioether linked light chain and heavy chain from the free light chain and the free heavy chain of a recombinant monoclonal antibody after reduction was also achieved. This optimized method provided a separation of antibody light chain and heavy chain based on size and allowed a direct measurement of molecular weights by mass spectrometry.

However, a more recently emerged top-down technology, now gaining more and more popularity, opens new perspectives for protein analysis and characterization, implying a need for efficient algorithms to process this kind of MS/MS data. Here, we describe a method that allows for the retrieval, from a set of top-down MS/MS spectra, of long and accurate sequence fragments of the proteins contained in the sample. To this end, we outline a strategy for generating high-quality sequence tags from top-down spectra, and introduce the concept of a T-Bruijn graph by adapting to the case of tags the notion of an A-Bruijn graph widely used in genomics. The output of the proposed approach represents the set of amino acid strings spelled out by optimal paths in the connected components of a T-Bruijn graph.

abstract = {With the rapid growth of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), stringent quality control is needed to ensure clinical safety and efficacy. Monoclonal antibody primary sequence and post-translational modifications (PTM) are conventionally analyzed with labor-intensive, bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), which is limited by incomplete peptide sequence coverage and introduction of artifacts during the lengthy analysis procedure. Here, we describe top-down and middle-down approaches with the advantages of fast sample preparation with minimal artifacts, ultrahigh mass accuracy, and extensive residue cleavages by use of 21 tesla FT-ICR MS/MS. The ultrahigh mass accuracy yields an RMS error of 0.2-0.4 ppm for antibody light chain, heavy chain, heavy chain Fc/2, and Fd subunits. The corresponding sequence coverages are 81{\%}, 38{\%}, 72{\%}, and 65{\%} with MS/MS RMS error {\~{}}4 ppm. Extension to a monoclonal antibody in human serum as a monoclonal gammopathy model yielded 53{\%} sequence coverage from two nano-LC MS/MS runs. A blind analysis of five therapeutic monoclonal antibodies at clinically relevant concentrations in human serum resulted in correct identification of all five antibodies. Nano-LC 21 T FT-ICR MS/MS provides nonpareil mass resolution, mass accuracy, and sequence coverage for mAbs, and sets a benchmark for MS/MS analysis of multiple mAbs in serum. This is the first time that extensive cleavages for both variable and constant regions have been achieved for mAbs in a human serum background. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.},

No method currently allows disentangling the millions of unique IgAs potentially present in the human antibody repertoire. Obtaining unambiguous sequence reads of their hypervariable antigen-binding regions is a prerequisite for IgA identification. We here report a mass spectrometric method that uses electron capture dissociation (ECD) to produce straightforward-to-read sequence ladders of the variable parts of both the light and heavy chains of IgA1s, in particular, of the functionally critical CDR3 regions. We directly compare the native top-down ECD spectra of a heavily and heterogeneously N- and O-glycosylated anti-CD20 IgA1, the corresponding N-glycosylated anti-CD20 IgG1, and their Fab parts. We show that while featuring very different MS1 spectra, the native top-down ECD MS2 spectra of all four species are nearly identical, with cleavages occurring specifically within the CDR3 and FR4 regions of both the heavy and light chain. From the sequence-informative ECD data of an intact glycosylated IgA1, we foresee that native top-down ECD will become a valuable complementary tool for the de novo sequencing of IgA1s from milk, saliva, or serum.},

abstract = {Over the past twenty years diverse groups in Northeast Asia, Western Europe, and North America have competed to map, sequence, and characterize the immunoglobulin loci of mouse and man. Now that this work is near completion, it has become evident that the human and mouse germline repertoires share broad similarities in gene composition, organization, and other general principles. In spite of these similarities, the repertoires expressed by adult mice and humans are distinct and differ from each other in detail. In both species the mechanisms used to create repertoire diversity appear designed to generate a random range of antigen binding sites. However, a detailed analysis reveals significant constraints in the sequence and amino acid composition of the third complementarity region of the H chain (CDR-H3), which lies at the center of the antigen binding site. The mechanisms used to regulate the composition of the repertoire, their significance to the development and maintenance of immune competence, and the contribution of violation of normal repertoire boundaries to the development of diseases of immune function remain foci of ongoing investigation.},

abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes neonatal abnormalities and other disorders. Antibodies to the ZIKV envelope (E) protein can block infection. In this study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) mRNA transcripts was combined with single-cell PCR cloning of E-binding monoclonal antibodies for analysing antibody response in a patient from the early stages of infection to more than one year after the clearance of the virus. The patient's IgH repertoire 14 and 64 days after symptom onset showed dramatic dominant clonal expansion but low clonal diversity. IgH repertoire 6 months after disease-free status had few dominant clones but increased diversity. E-binding antibodies appeared abundantly in the repertoire during the early stages of infection but quickly declined after clearance of the virus. Certain VH genes such as VH5-10-1 and VH4-39 appeared to be preferentially enlisted for a rapid antibody response to ZIKV infection. Most of these antibodies require relatively few somatic hypermutations to acquire the ability to bind to the E protein, pointing to a possible mechanism for rapid defence against ZIKV infection. This study provides a unique and holistic view of the dynamic changes and characteristics of the antibody response to ZIKV infection.},

@article{Fischer2003,
abstract = {De novo sequencing of peptides poses one of the most challenging tasks in data analysis for proteome research. In this paper, a generative hidden Markov model (HMM) of mass spectra for de novo peptide sequencing which constitutes a novel view on how to solve this problem in a Bayesian framework is proposed. Further extensions of the model structure to a graphical model and a factorial HMM to substantially improve the peptide identification results are demonstrated. Inference with the graphical model for de novo peptide sequencing estimates posterior probabilities for amino acids rather than scores for single symbols in the sequence. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for de novo peptide sequencing on a large test set of spectra. In the process of high-throughput protein identification, mass spectrometry has attained considerable importance during the most recent years. 1 Analysis based on mass spectrometry typically starts with a complex protein mixture which is fractionated by either gel electrophoresis or other fractionation methods to reduce the complexity of the sample. The proteins are then digested by a specific enzyme, such as trypsin. The resulting set of peptides is measured by a tandem mass spectrometer coupled with a high performance liquid chromatography device. In the first measurement stage of a tandem mass spectrometer, the total mass of the different peptides eluting at a certain time point from the column is determined. In the second stage, a subset of peptides of a certain small mass range is selected. These peptides are fragmented by low-energy collision with a noble gas. This fragmentation process finally yields the MS/MS spectra that ideally contain the masses of all N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of the designated peptides. The inherently high noise level of mass spectra in high-throughput experiments strongly favors probabilistic models of the data generation process. In this paper, we propose NovoHMM, a novel and completely generative statistical model for mass spectra which arise from peptide sequences. 1 (A preliminary version of this model was presented at the NIPS conference. 2) The data generation process is assumed to be adequately described by a hidden Markov model with hidden amino acid states along the mass axis of a spectrum and observable emissions of mass peaks for each state. The model is generative in the sense that typical spectra can be sampled from the estimated model, given a peptide sequence. The complete HMM produces computational costs which scale quadratically in the number of states. To reduce the computational and model complexity, the complete model is approximated by a factorial hidden Markov model. The factorial model implicitly estimates whether a certain peak has been generated by an N-terminal or a C-terminal fragment. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used to estimate these hidden variables. The complexity regularization mechanism by factorization leads to an improved predictive power of the model. As a particular advantage for inference, NovoHMM explicitly represents probabilistic estimates of the posterior, both for the whole sequence and for single amino acids. In the Experimental Section, we compare NovoHMM with other de novo peptide sequencing methods, especially with PepNovo 3 which presumably is the best existing de novo sequenc-ing method for doubly charged ion trap spectra. The experiments effectively show that our approach outperforms PepNovo and other competitors on the same benchmark dataset on which PepNovo was tested. In addition, we show that the model yields reliable estimates of the peptide's parent masses. The Bayesian modeling approach allows us to provide a fully probabilistic posterior estimate for each amino acid. Related Work. The interpretation of the tandem MS spectra usually starts with a database search in cases for which a database of known proteins is available for the organism under investigation. The most popular database search tools are SEQUEST 4 and MASCOT. 5 In recent publications, probabilistic models for database searches have been reported, such as OLAV 6 and SCOPE. 7 (2) Fischer, B.; Roth, V.; Buhmann, J.

Integrating these effects into a quantitative model captures the reduced ability to detect species over 25 kDa with the speed and sensitivity characteristic of proteomics based on {\textless}3 kDa peptide ions. The model quantifies the challenge that top-down proteomics faces with respect to current MS instrumentation and projects that depletion of (13)C and (15)N isotopes can improve detection at high mass by only {\textless}2-fold at 100 kDa whereas the effect is up to 5-fold at 10 kDa.

abstract = {Therapeutic proteins contain a large number of post-translational modifications, some of which could potentially impact their safety or efficacy. In one of these changes, pyroglutamate can form on the N terminus of the polypeptide chain. Both glutamine and glutamate at the N termini of recombinant monoclonal antibodies can cyclize spontaneously to pyroglutamate (pE) in vitro. Glutamate conversion to pyroglutamate occurs more slowly than from glutamine but has been observed under near physiological conditions. Here we investigated to what extent human IgG2 N-terminal glutamate converts to pE in vivo. Pyroglutamate levels increased over time after injection into humans, with the rate of formation differing between polypeptide chains. These changes were replicated for the same antibodies in vitro under physiological pH and temperature conditions, indicating that the changes observed in vivo were due to chemical conversion not differential clearance. Differences in the conversion rates between the light chain and heavy chain on an antibody were eliminated by denaturing the protein, revealing that structural elements affect pE formation rates. By enzymatically releasing pE from endogenous antibodies isolated from human serum, we could estimate the naturally occurring levels of this post-translational modification. Together, these techniques and results can be used to predict the exposure of pE for therapeutic antibodies and to guide criticality assessments for this attribute. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Shotgun proteomics is a powerful tool for identifying the protein content of complex mixtures via liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The most widely used class of algorithms for analyzing mass spectra of peptides has been database search software such as SEQUEST. A new sequence tag database search algorithm, called GutenTag, makes it possible to identify peptides with unknown posttranslational modifications or sequence variations. This software automates the process of inferring partial sequence "tags" directly from the spectrum and efficiently examines a sequence database for peptides that match these tags. When multiple candidate sequences result from the database search, the software evaluates which is the best match by a rapid examination of spectral fragment ions. We compare GutenTag's accuracy to that of SEQUEST on a defined protein mixture, showing that both modified and unmodified peptides can be successfully identified by this approach. GutenTag analyzed 33 000 spectra from a human lens sample, identifying peptides that were missed in prior SEQUEST analysis due to sequence polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications. The software is available under license; visit http://fields.scripps.edu for information. Tandem mass spectrometry has been established as a powerful analytical tool for proteomics. Hunt and others 1 demonstrated the ability to sequence peptides directly from tandem mass spectra in the mid-1980s. Yates and Eng 2 automated this process by comparing database-derived sequences to uninterpreted tandem mass spectra. Improved separation technologies automated the analysis of samples ranging from protein complexes 3 to whole cell lysates 4 for protein content and protein modifications. As these technologies have been refined, the emphasis in proteomics has shifted from protein identification to posttranslational modification identification 5 and protein quantitation. 6 Tandem mass spectra of peptides reveal sequences because they show the fragmentation products of peptides. 7 Ions of a peptide eluting from liquid chromatography are isolated by the mass spectrometer and collided energetically with inert gas molecules. Each peptide precursor breaks preferentially at a peptide bond, producing two fragments (one from the N-terminal b series, and one from the C-terminal y series). The fragment ions from thousands of such breakages form a tandem mass spectrum, where each ion is represented by a peak with a recorded intensity and a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. Each tandem mass spectrum indicates the sequence of a peptide by two superimposed ladders of sequence ions, though typically some fragment ions from each series do not appear in the spectrum.

abstract = {Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading neonatal pathogen and a growing cause of invasive disease in the elderly, with clinical manifestations such as pneumonia and sepsis. Despite its clinical importance, little is known about innate immunity against GBS in humans. Here, we analyze the role of human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA), a bactericidal enzyme induced during acute inflammation, in innate immunity against GBS. We show that clinical GBS isolates are highly sensitive to killing by sPLA2-IIA but not by human antimicrobial peptides. Using transgenic mice that express human sPLA2-IIA, we demonstrate that this enzyme is crucial for host protection against systemic infection and lung challenge by GBS. We found that acute sera from humans diagnosed with invasive GBS disease contain increased levels of sPLA2-IIA compared with normal sera from healthy individuals, indicating that GBS induces an sPLA2-IIA response in blood during human infection. We demonstrate that clinically relevant GBS strains are rapidly killed in these acute sera. We also demonstrate that the bactericidal effect is entirely due to sPLA2-IIA, showing that sPLA2-IIA might represent an important component of humoral innate immunity against GBS. Our data provide experimental and clinical evidence that sPLA2-IIA protects humans against GBS infections.},

Since variations in germline genes have been linked to various diseases, personalized immunogenomics aims at finding alleles of germline genes across various patients. Although recent studies described algorithms for de novo inference of V and J genes from immunosequencing data, they stopped short of solving a more difficult problem of reconstructing D genes that form the highly divergent CDR3 regions and provide the most important contribution to the antigen binding. We present the IgScout algorithm for de novo D gene reconstruction and apply it to reveal new alleles of human D genes and previously unknown D genes in camel, an important model organism in immunology. We further analyze non-canonical V(DD)J recombination that results in unusually long CDR3s with tandem fused IGHD genes and thus expands the diversity of the antibody repertoires. We demonstrate that tandem CDR3s represent a consistent and functional feature of all analyzed immunosequencing datasets, reveal ultra-long CDR3s, and shed light on the mechanism responsible for their formation.},

abstract = {The human and mouse antibody repertoires are formed by identical processes, but like all small animals, mice only have sufficient lymphocytes to express a small part of the potential antibody repertoire. In this study, we determined how the heavy chain repertoires of two mouse strains are generated. Analysis of IgM- and IgG-associatedVDJ rearrangements generated by high-throughput sequencing confirmed the presence of 99 functional immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes in the C57BL/6 genome, and inferred the presence of 164 IGHV genes in the BALB/c genome. Remarkably, only five IGHV sequences were common to both strains. Compared with humans, little N nucleotide addition was seen in the junctions of mouse VDJ genes. Germline human IgG-associated IGHV genes are rare, but many murine IgG-associated IGHVgeneswere unmutated. Together these results suggest that the expressed mouse repertoire is more germline-focused than the human repertoire. The apparently divergent germline repertoires of the mouse strains are discussed with reference to reports that inbred mouse strains carry blocks of genes derived from each of the three subspecies of the house mouse. We hypothesize that the germline genes of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice may originally have evolved to generate distinct germline-focused antibody repertoires in the different mouse subspecies.},

abstract = {B lymphocytes play a pivotal role in multiple sclerosis pathology, possibly via both antibody-dependent and -independent pathways. Intrathecal immunoglobulin G in multiple sclerosis is produced by clonally expanded B-cell populations. Recent studies indicate that the complementarity determining regions of immunoglobulins specific for certain antigens are frequently shared between different individuals. In this study, our main objective was to identify specific proteomic profiles of mutated complementarity determining regions of immunoglobulin G present in multiple sclerosis patients but absent in healthy controls. To achieve this objective, we purified immunoglobulin G from the cerebrospinal fluid of 29 multiple sclerosis patients and 30 healthy controls and separated the corresponding heavy and light chains via SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, bands were excised, trypsinized, and measured with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We sequenced 841 heavy and 771 light chain variable region peptides. We observed 24 heavy and 26 light chain complementarity determining regions that were solely present in a number of multiple sclerosis patients. Using stringent criteria for the identification of common peptides, we found five complementarity determining regions shared in three or more patients and not in controls. Interestingly, one complementarity determining region with a single mutation was found in six patients. Additionally, one other patient carrying a similar complementarity determining region with another mutation was observed. In addition, we found a skew in the -to-{\$}\lambda{\$} ratio and in the usage of certain variable heavy regions that was previously observed at the transcriptome level. At the protein level, cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G shares common characteristics in the antigen binding region among different multiple sclerosis patients. The indication of a shared fingerprint may indicate common antigens for B-cell activation. {\textcopyright}2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {There are several computer programs that can match peptide tandem mass spectrometry data to their exactly corresponding database sequences, and in most protein identification projects, these programs are utilized in the early stages of data interpretation. However, situations frequently arise where tandem mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequences. In these cases, the unmatched data could be due to peptides derived from novel proteins, allelic or species-derived variants of known proteins, or posttranslational or chemical modifications. Two additional problems are frequently encountered in high-throughput protein identification. First, it is difficult to quickly sift through large amounts of data to identify those spectra that, due to poor signal or contaminants, can be ignored. Second, it is important to find incorrect database matches (false positives). We have chosen to address these difficulties by performing automatic de novo sequencing using a computer program called Lutefisk. Sequence candidates obtained are used as input in a homology-based database search program called CIDentify to identify variants of known proteins. Comparison of database-derived sequences with de novo sequences allows for electronic validation of database matches even if the latter are not completely correct. Modifications to the original Lutefisk program have been implemented to handle data obtained from triple quadrupole, ion trap, and quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid (Qtof) mass spectrometers. For example, the linearity of mass errors due to temperature-dependent expansion of the flight tube in a Qtof was exploited such that isobaric amino acids (glutamine/lysine and oxidized methionine/ phenylalanine) can be differentiated without careful attention to mass calibration.},

abstract = {A diverse antibody repertoire is primarily generated by the rearrangement of V, D, and J genes and subsequent somatic hypermutation (SHM). Class-switch recombination (CSR) produces various isotypes and subclasses with different functional properties. Although antibody isotypes and subclasses are considered to be produced by both direct and sequential CSR, it is still not fully understood how SHMs accumulate during the process in which antibody subclasses are generated. Here, we developed a new next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based antibody repertoire analysis capable of identifying all antibody isotype and subclass genes and used it to examine the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 12 healthy individuals. Using a total of 5,480,040 sequences, we compared percentage frequency of variable (V), junctional (J) sequence, and a combination of V and J, diversity, length, and amino acid compositions of CDR3, SHM, and shared clones in the IgM, IgD, IgG3, IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, IgA1, IgE, and IgA2 genes. The usage and diversity were similar among the immunoglobulin (Ig) subclasses. Clonally related sequences sharing identical V, D, J, and CDR3 amino acid sequences were frequently found within multiple Ig subclasses, especially between IgG1 and IgG2 or IgA1 and IgA2. SHM occurred most frequently in IgG4, while IgG3 genes were the least mutated among all IgG subclasses. The shared clones had almost the same SHM levels among Ig subclasses, while subclass-specific clones had different levels of SHM dependent on the genomic location. Given the sequential CSR, these results suggest that CSR occurs sequentially over multiple subclasses in the order corresponding to the genomic location of IGHCs, but CSR is likely to occur more quickly than SHMs accumulate within Ig genes under physiological conditions. NGS-based antibody repertoire analysis should provide critical information on how various antibodies are generated in the immune system.},

Hence, anti-IgE antibodies that block binding of IgE to its high-affinity receptor are of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of allergy. These antibodies must also not bind to IgE once it is bound to the receptor because this would trigger histamine release. This study describes the humanization of a murine antibody, MaE11, with these characteristics. Variants of the humanized antibody were evaluated to probe the importance of framework residues on antibody binding and to determine which charged residues in the CDR interacted with IgE. We found that only five changes in human framework residues were required to provide for binding comparable to that of the original murine antibody.},

In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel MS/MS antibody discovery approach in which only serum antibodies are required without the need for sequencing of genetic material. Peripheral pAbs from a cytomegalovirus-exposed individual were purified by glycoprotein B antigen affinity and de novo sequenced from MS/MS data. Purely MS-derived mAbs were then manufactured in mammalian cells to validate potency via antigen-binding ELISA. Interestingly, we found that these mAbs accounted for 1 to 2{\%} of total donor IgG but were not detected in parallel sequencing of memory B cells from the same patient.},

abstract = {IMGT R , the international ImMunoGeneTics information system R (http://www.imgt.org) is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. By its creation in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Uni-versit{\'{e}}versit´versit{\'{e}} de Montpellier and CNRS), IMGT R marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformat-ics. IMGT R is specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major his-tocompatibility (MH) and proteins of the IgSF and MhSF superfamilies. IMGT R is built on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts, which bridged the gap between genes, sequences and 3D structures. The concepts include the IMGT R standardized keywords (identification), IMGT R standardized labels (description), IMGT R standardized nomenclature (classification), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles (numerotation). IMGT R comprises 7 databases, 17 online tools and 15 000 pages of web resources, and provides a high-quality and integrated system for analysis of the genomic and expressed IG and TR repertoire of the adaptive immune responses, including NGS high-throughput data. Tools and databases are used in basic, veterinary and medical research, in clinical applications (mutation analysis in leukemia and lymphoma) and in antibody engineering and humanization. The IMGT/mAb-DB interface was developed for therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins for immunologi-cal applications (FPIA). IMGT R is freely available at http://www.imgt.org.},

abstract = {Antibodies (Abs) produced by immunoglobulin (IG) genes are the most diverse proteins expressed in humans. While part of this diversity is generated by recombination during B-cell development and mutations during affinity matu-ration, the germ-line IG loci are also diverse across human populations and ethnicities. Recently, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated genotype-phenotype correlations between specific IG germ-line variants and the quality of Ab responses during vaccination and disease. However, the functional consequences of IG genetic variation in Ab function and immunological outcomes remain underexplored. In this opinion article, we outline interconnec-tions between IG genomic diversity and Ab-expressed repertoires and structure. We further propose a strategy for integrating IG genotyping with functional Ab profiling data as a means to better predict and optimize humoral responses in genetically diverse human populations, with immediate implications for personalized medicine. The Molecular Basis for Antibody Diversity Antibodies (Abs) have long been appreciated as key constituents of the adaptive immune response. Their function is to enable selective recognition and mediate immune responses to novel foreign antigens. This is accomplished through the somatic generation of vast repertoires of hundreds of millions of unique Ab receptors that can be selected, matured, and ultimately participate in the formation of long-term memory during B-cell development and activation. As a consequence of this diversity, even after nearly a century of research, the complexity of the Ab response within and between individuals is only beginning to be delineated at the molecular and genetic levels. Hundreds of variable (V) and dozens of diversity (D) and joining (J) immunoglobulin (IG) germ-line gene segments across three primary loci in the human genome comprise the necessary building blocks of the expressed Ab heavy-and light-chain repertoires [1]. Whereas the heavy chain is encoded by genes at the IG heavy-chain locus (IGH), the light chain can be encoded by genes at either the IG kappa (IGK) or IG lambda (IGL) chain loci [1]. The na{\"{i}}ve Ab repertoire is formed by assembling variants of these building blocks using a specialized V(D)J recombination process that somatically joins various V, D, and J segments (or V and J at IGK and IGL[ 2 2 8 {\_} T D {\$} D},

abstract = {Many successful, recent therapies for life-threatening diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis are based on the recognition between native or genetically engineered antibodies and cell-surface receptors. Although naturally produced by the immune system, the need for antibodies with unique specificities and designed for single application, has encouraged the search for novel antibody purification strategies. The availability of these products to the end-consumer is strictly related to manufacture costs, particularly those attributed to downstream processing. Over the last decades, academia and industry have developed different types of interactions and separation techniques for antibody purification, affinity-based strategies being the most common and efficient methodologies. The affinity ligands utilized range from biological to synthetic designed molecules with enhanced resistance and stability. Despite the successes achieved, the purification "paradigm" still moves interests and efforts in the continuous demand for improved separation performances. This review will focus on recent advances and perspectives in antibody purification by affinity interactions using different techniques, with particular emphasis on affinity chromatography. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

These mAbs were isolated from two donors who had recovered from COVID-19 infection during the first pandemic peak in the Lombardy region of Italy, the first European and initially most affected region in March 2020. We used the method of EBV immortalization of purified memory B cells and supernatant screening with a spike S1/2 assay for mAb isolation. This method allowed rapid isolation of clones, with one donor showing about 7{\%} of clones positive against spike protein, whereas the other donor did not produce positive clones out of 91 tested. RNA was extracted from positive clones 39–47 days post-EBV infection, allowing VH and VL sequencing. The same clones were sequenced again after a further 100 days in culture, showing that no mutation had taken place during in vitro expansion. The B cell clones could be expanded in culture for more than 4 months after EBV immortalization and secreted the antibodies stably during that time, allowing to purify mg quantities of each mAb for functional assays without generating recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, neither mAb had significant neutralizing activity in a virus infection assay with several different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The antibody sequences are made freely available.},

abstract = {For proteins of {\textless}20 kDa, this new radical site dissociation method cleaves different and many more backbone bonds than the conventional MS/MS methods (e.g., collisionaUy activated dissociation, CAD) that add energy directly to the even-electron ions. A minimum kinetic energy difference between the electron and ion maximizes capture; a 1 eV difference reduces capture by 103. Thus, in an FTMS ion cell with added electron trapping electrodes, capture appears to be achieved best at the boundary between the potential wells that trap the electrons and ions, now providing 80 ± 15{\%} precursor ion conversion efficiency. Capture cross section is dependent on the ionic charge squared (z2), minimizing the secondary dissociation of lower charge fragment ions. Electron capture is postulated to occur initially at a protonated site to release an energetic (∼6 eV) Ḣ atom that is captured at a high-affinity site such as -S-S- or backbone amide to cause nonergodic (before energy randomization) dissociation. Cleavages between every pair of amino acids in mellitin (2.8 kDa) and ubiquitin (8.6 kDa) are represented in their ECD and CAD spectra, providing complete data for their de novo sequencing. Because posttranslational modifications such as carboxylation, gh/cosylation, and sulfation are less easily lost in ECD than in CAD, ECD assignments of their sequence positions are far more specific. {\textcopyright}2000 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become a standard way for identifying peptides and proteins. A scoring function plays an important role in the MS/MS data analysis. De novo sequencing is the computational step to derive a peptide sequence from an MS/MS spectrum, normally by constructing the peptide that maximizes the scoring function. A number of polynomial time algorithms have been developed based on scoring functions that consider only either the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment ions of the peptide. It remains unknown whether the consideration of the internal fragment ions will still be polynomial time solvable. In this paper, we prove that the internal fragment ions make the de novo sequencing problem NP-complete. We also propose a regression model based scoring method to incorporate correlations between the fragment ions. Our scoring function is combined with PEAKS de novo sequencing algorithm and tested on ion trap data. The experimental results show that the regression model based scoring method can remarkably improve the de novo sequencing accuracy.},

abstract = {De novo peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry represents an important strategy for characterizing novel peptides and proteins, in which a peptide's amino acid sequence is inferred directly from the precursor peptide mass and tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS or MS 3) fragment ions, without comparison to a reference proteome. This method is ideal for organisms or samples lacking a complete or well-annotated reference sequence set. One of the major barriers to de novo spectral interpretation arises from confusion of N-and C-terminal ion series due to the symmetry between b and y ion pairs created by collisional activation methods (or c, z ions for electron-based activation methods). This is known as the "antisymmetric path problem" and leads to inverted amino acid subsequences within a de novo reconstruction. Here, we combine several key strategies for de novo peptide sequencing into a single high-throughput pipeline: high-efficiency carbamylation blocks lysine side chains, and subsequent tryptic digestion and N-terminal peptide derivatization with the ultraviolet chromophore AMCA yield peptides susceptible to 351 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD). UVPD-MS/MS of the AMCA-modified peptides then predominantly produces y ions in the MS/MS spectra, specifically addressing the antisymmetric path problem. Finally, the program UVnovo applies a random forest algorithm to automatically learn from and then interpret UVPD mass spectra, passing results to a hidden Markov model for de novo sequence prediction and scoring. We show this combined strategy provides high-performance de novo peptide sequencing, enabling the de novo sequencing of thousands of peptides from an Escherichia coli lysate at high confidence. T he breadth of proteomic studies has never been greater, as a growing trend in proteomics research pushes mass spectrometry experiments beyond the study of model organisms, proteotypic peptides, and common posttranslational modifications. This strains the limits of traditional spectral interpretation using sequence databases, and it has driven development of more flexible search methods and proteoge-nomic pipelines. De novo peptide and protein sequencing is one potential strategy for characterizing novel peptides. 1 Rather than comparing a peptide spectrum to theoretical candidate spectra from a reference protein sequence database, de novo analysis directly infers a peptide sequence from the precursor peptide mass and tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS or MS 3) fragment ions. 2 This method is ideal for organisms or samples lacking a complete or well-annotated reference sequence set. In the event that gene sequences are available, de novo approaches are well-suited for interpreting unidentified spectra and discovering unknown splice variants, intergenic peptides, sequence polymorphisms, and other novel peptides. Given an ideal MS/MS spectrum, de novo peptide sequence assignment is a trivial exercise. Such a spectrum would exhibit a complete series of ions, all of a single-fragment type (N-terminal a/b/c or C-terminal x/y/z ions) and known charge state, that span an entire precursor peptide. The sequence could then be read directly from the spectrum by matching the mass difference between each consecutive ion pair to its corresponding amino acid. Technological developments, notably high-resolution MS/MS acquisition and concurrent collection of complementary fragmentation spectra (e.g., paired collision-induced dissociation (CID)/electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectra), have greatly improved the potential of de novo peptide sequencing, but spectra still suffer from incomplete peptide fragmentation, complex fragmentation patterns and neutral losses, and uninterpretable noise. CID, 3,4 HCD, 5 ETD, 6,7 and dual fragmentation (EThcD, ETciD), 8 have all been applied for de novo sequencing. Infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and ultraviolet photo},

abstract = {In cancer and autoimmune diseases, immunoglobulins with a specific molecular signature that could potentially be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers are released into body fluids. An immunomics approach based on this phenomenon relies on the ability to identify the specific amino acid sequences of the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of these immunoglobulins, which in turn depends on the level of accuracy, resolution, and sensitivity that can be achieved by advanced mass spectrometry. Reproducible isolation and sequencing of antibody fragments (e.g., Fab) by high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) from seven healthy donors revealed 43 217 MS signals: 225 could be associated with CDR1 peptides, 513 with CDR2 peptides, and 19 with CDR3 peptides. Seventeen percent of the 43 217 MS signals did not overlap between the seven donors. The Fab isolation method used is reproducible and fast, with a high yield. It provides only one Fab sample fraction for subsequent characterization by high-resolution MS. In 17{\%} and 4{\%} of these seven healthy donors, qualitative (presence/absence) and quantitative (intensity) differences in Fab fragments could be demonstrated, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the identification of a CDR signature as biomarker for autoimmune diseases and cancer without prior knowledge of the antigen is feasible. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease.

Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P{\textless}0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: {\textless}40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

abstract = {The sequence tag-based peptide identification methods are a promising alternative to the traditional database search approach. However, a more comprehensive analysis, optimization, and comparison with established methods are necessary before these methods can gain widespread use in the proteomics community. Using the InsPecT open source code base ( Tanner et al., Anal. Chem. 2005, 77, 4626- 39 ), we present an improved sequence tag generation method that directly incorporates multicharged fragment ion peaks present in many tandem mass spectra of higher charge states. We also investigate the performance of sequence tagging under different settings using control data sets generated on five different types of mass spectrometers, as well as using a complex phosphopeptide-enriched sample. We also demonstrate that additional modeling of InsPecT search scores using a semiparametric approach incorporating the accuracy of the precursor ion mass measurement provides additional improvement in the ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect peptide identifications. The overall superior performance of the sequence tag-based peptide identification method is demonstrated by comparison with a commonly used SEQUEST/PeptideProphet approach.},

abstract = {Nonprecipitating active fragments of rabbit antiovalbumin {\$}\gamma{\$}-globulin, having approximately the same sedimentation coefficient (3.5 S) and inhibitory effect on the homologous precipitin reaction as the univalent fragments produced by papain, can be prepared by treatment with pepsin in the presence of a reagent capable of breaking disulfide bonds. The reaction can also be carried out by successive treatments with pepsin and one of several such reagents. Cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine, thioglycolate, and cyanide were effective. In the absence of enzyme, but under otherwise identical conditions, these compounds had no apparent effect on the antibody. The combining sites on fragments of an antihapten antibody produced by this method were found, by hapten-binding measurements, to be essentially intact, although the capacity to form specific precipitates was lost. This fact and the close similarity to the univalent fragments formed by the action of papain indicate that the active split products produced by pepsin under these conditions are univalent. Peptic digestion causes a decrease in sedimentation coefficient to about 5 S, but the capacity to form specific precipitates is largely retained, indicating that the 5 S fragment is bivalent. Further treatment with a disulfide-splitting reagent results in the formation of fragments with the properties of univalent antibody and s ≅ 3.5. The results indicate that the proteolytic enzyme splits off an inactive portion of the molecule; and that subsequent to this reaction the bivalent residue can be divided into two univalent fragments by breaking the disulfide bonds which hold them together. Because compounds which react with disulfide groups have always been used with papain, as activators of the enzyme, it appears that a similar mechanism may obtain in the digestion of rabbit antibody by that enzyme. Since Porter has shown that the two active fragments (3.5 S) released by papain are nearly identical in molecular weight and amino acid composition, the possibility is suggested that the biosynthesis of rabbit antibody may include linkage of these two nearly identical univalent subunits through one or more disulfide bonds. {\textcopyright}1960.},

abstract = {A method is described for searching protein sequence databases using tandem mass spectra of tryptic peptides. The approach uses a de novo sequencing algorithm to derive a short list of possible sequence candidates which serve as query sequences in a subsequent homology-based database search routine. The sequencing algorithm employs a graph theory approach similar to previously described sequencing programs. In addition, amino acid composition, peptide sequence tags and incomplete or ambiguous Edman sequence data can be used to aid in the sequence determinations. Although sequencing of peptides from tandem mass spectra is possible, one of the frequently encountered difficulties is that several alternative sequences can be deduced from one spectrum. Most of the alternative sequences, however, are sufficiently similar for a homology-based sequence database search to be possible. Unfortunately, the available protein sequence database search algorithms (e.g. Blast or FASTA) require a single unambiguous sequence as input. Here we describe how the publicly available FASTA computer program was modified in order to search protein databases more effectively in spite of the ambiguities intrinsic in de novo peptide sequencing algorithms.},

abstract = {Established guidelines from the International Myeloma Working Group recommend diagnostic screening for patients suspected of plasma cell proliferative disease using protein electrophoresis (PEL), free light chain measurements and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) of serum and urine in certain cases. Plasma cell proliferative disorders are generally classified as monoclonal gammopathies given most are associated with the excess secretion of a monoclonal immunoglobulin or M-protein. In clinical practice, the M-protein is detected in a patients' serum by the appearance of a distinct protein band migrating within regions typically occupied by immunoglobulins. Given each M-protein is comprised by a sequence of amino acids pre-defined by somatic recombination unique to each clonal plasma cell, the molecular mass of the M-protein can act as a surrogate marker. We established a mass spectrometry based method to assign molecular mass to the immunoglobulin light chain of the M-protein and used this to detect the presence of M-proteins. Our method first enriches serum for immunoglobulins, followed by reduction to separate light chains from heavy chains, followed by microflow LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS. The multiply charged light chain ions are converted to their molecular mass and reconstructed peak area calculations are used for quantification. Using this method, we term "monoclonal immunoglobulin Rapid Accurate Molecular Mass" or miRAMM, the presence of M-proteins can be reliably detected with superior sensitivity compared to current gel-based PEL and IFE techniques.},

abstract = {Immunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of 2 heavy and 2 light chains. They can be separated functionally into variable domains that bind antigens and constant domains that specify effector functions, such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors. The variable domains are created by means of a complex series of gene rearrangement events and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutation after exposure to antigen to allow affinity maturation. Each variable domain can be split into 3 regions of sequence variability termed the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and 4 regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions. The 3 CDRs of the heavy chain are paired with the 3 CDRs of the light chain to form the antigen-binding site, as classically defined. The constant domains of the heavy chain can be switched to allow altered effector function while maintaining antigen specificity. There are 5 main classes of heavy chain constant domains. Each class defines the IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE isotypes. IgG can be split into 4 subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, each with its own biologic properties, and IgA can similarly be split into IgA1 and IgA2.},

abstract = {Motivation: Peptide identification following tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is usually achieved by searching for the best match between the mass spectrum of an unidentified peptide and model spectra generated from peptides in a sequence database. This methodology will be successful only if the peptide under investigation belongs to an available database. Our objective is to develop and test the performance of a heuristic optimization algorithm capable of dealing with some features commonly found in actual MS/MS spectra that tend to stop simpler deterministic solution approaches. Results: We present the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the reconstruction of amino acid sequences using only spectral features, discuss some of the problems associated with this approach and compare its performance to a de novo sequencing method. The GA can potentially overcome some of the most problematic aspect associated with de novo analysis of real MS/MS data such as missing or unclearly defined peaks and may prove to be a valuable tool in the proteomics field. We assess the performance of our algorithm under conditions of perfect spectral information, in situations where key spectral features are missing, and using real MS/MS spectral data. {\textcopyright}Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of approved biotherapeutics, e.g., monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulins G (IgGs), demands improved techniques for their quality control. Traditionally, proteolysis-based bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) has been employed. However, the long, multistep sample preparation protocols required for bottom-up MS are known to potentially introduce artifacts in the original sample. For this reason, a top-down MS approach would be preferable. The current performance of top-down MS of intact monoclonal IgGs, though, enables reaching only up to ∼30{\%} sequence coverage, with incomplete sequencing of the complementarity determining regions which are fundamental for IgG's antigen binding. Here, we describe a middle-down MS protocol based on the use of immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS), which is capable of digesting IgGs in only 30 min. After chemical reduction, the obtained ∼25 kDa proteolytic fragments were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled online with an electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-enabled hybrid Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Elite FTMS). Upon optimization of ETD and product ion transfer parameters, results show that up to ∼50{\%} sequence coverage for selected IgG fragments is reached in a single LC run and up to ∼70{\%} when data obtained by distinct LC−MS runs are averaged. Importantly, we demonstrate the potential of this middle-down approach in the identification of oxidized methionine residues. The described approach shows a particular potential for the analysis of IgG mixtures.},

abstract = {Most analyses of the antibody responses induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have focused on antibodies cloned from memory B cells. This approach has led researchers to conclude that neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) primarily target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus's spike protein. Voss et al. took a different approach, using proteomic deconvolution of the serum immunoglobulin G antibody repertoire from four COVID-19 convalescent patients. They found that the nAb response was largely directed against epitopes such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), which lie outside the RBD. Several of these nAbs were shared among donors and targeted an NTD epitope that is frequently mutated by variants of concern.

Science , abg5268, this issue p. [1108][1]

The molecular composition and binding epitopes of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are unknown. Proteomic deconvolution of the IgG repertoire to the spike glycoprotein in convalescent subjects revealed that the response is directed predominantly ({\textgreater}80{\%}) against epitopes residing outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). In one subject, just four IgG lineages accounted for 93.5{\%} of the response, including an amino (N)-terminal domain (NTD)–directed antibody that was protective against lethal viral challenge. Genetic, structural, and functional characterization of a multidonor class of “public” antibodies revealed an NTD epitope that is recurrently mutated among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These data show that “public” NTD-directed and other non-RBD plasma antibodies are prevalent and have implications for SARS-CoV-2 protection and antibody escape.

abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has played a vital role across a broad range of fields and applications in proteomics. The development of high-resolution MS has significantly advanced biology in areas such as protein structure, function, post-translational modification and global protein dynamics. The two most widely used MS ionization techniques in proteomics are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). ESI typically yields multiple charge values for each molecular mass and an isotopic cluster for each nominal mass-to-charge (m/z) value. Although MALDI mass spectra typically contain only singly charged ions, overlapping isotope patterns can be problematic for accurate mass measurement. To overcome these challenges of overlapping isotope patterns associated with complex samples in MS-based proteomics research, deconvolution strategies are being used. This manuscript describes a wide variety of deconvolution strategies, including de-isotoping and de-charging processes, deconvolution of co-eluting isomers or peptides with different sequences in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes, and data analysis in intact protein mass determination, ion mobility MS, native MS, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS. It concludes with a discussion of future prospects in the development of bioinformatics and potential new applications in proteomics.},

abstract = {Recently, a mass spectrometry-based approach was introduced to directly assess the IgG1 immunoglobulin clonal repertoires in plasma. Here we expanded upon this approach by describing a mass spectrometry-based technique to assess specifically the clonal repertoire of another important class of immunoglobulin molecules, IgA1, and show it is efficiently and robustly applicable to either milk or plasma samples. Focusing on two individual healthy donors, whose milk was sampled longitudinally during the first 16 weeks of lactation, we demonstrate that the total repertoire of milk sIgA1 is dominated by only 50-500 clones, even though the human body theoretically can generate several orders of magnitude more clones. We show that in each donor the sIgA1 repertoire only changes marginally and quite gradually over the monitored 16-week period of lactation. Furthermore, the observed overlap in clonal repertoires between the two individual donors is close to non-existent. Mothers provide protection to their newborn infants directly by the transfer of antibodies via breastfeeding. The approach introduced here, can be used to visualize the clonal repertoire transferred from mother to infant and to detect changes in-time in that repertoire adapting to changes in maternal physiology.},

@article{Azari2019,
abstract = {Proteomics is the large-scale analysis of the proteins. The common method for identifying proteins and characterising their amino acid sequences is to digest the proteins into peptides, analyse the peptides using mass spectrometry and assign the resulting tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to peptides using database search tools. However, database search algorithms are highly dependent on a reference protein database and they cannot identify peptides and proteins not included in the database. Therefore, de novo sequencing algorithms are developed to overcome the problem by directly reconstructing the peptide sequence of an MS/MS spectrum without using any protein database. Current de novo sequencing algorithms often fail to construct the completely matched sequences, and produce partial matches. In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm based method, GA-Novo, to solve the complex optimisation task of de novo peptide sequencing, aiming at constructing full length sequences. Given an MS/MS spectrum, GA-Novo optimises the amino acid sequences to best fit the input spectrum. On the testing dataset, GA-Novo outperforms PEAKS, the most commonly used software for this task, by constructing 8{\%} higher number of fully matched peptide sequences, and 4{\%} higher recall at partially matched sequences.},

Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1{\%} false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., {\textless}1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.},

Full sequence coverage is typically used to verify the integrity of the analytical data obtained following the combination of multiple LC-MS/MS datasets from orthogonal protease digests (so called "bottom-up" approaches). Top-down or middle-down mass spectrometric approaches have the potential to minimize artifacts, reduce overall analysis time and provide orthogonality to this traditional approach. In this work we report a new combined approach involving middle-up LC-QTOF and middle-down LC-MALDI in-source decay (ISD) mass spectrometry.

The goal was to unambiguously confirm their reference sequences and examine the general applicability of this approach. Furthermore, a new measure for assessing the integrity and validity of results from middle-down approaches is introduced-the "Sequence Validation Percentage." Full sequence data assessment of the 3 antibodies was achieved enabling all 3 sequences to be fully validated by a combination of middle-up molecular weight determination and middle-down protein sequencing. Three errors in the reference amino acid sequence of natalizumab, causing a cumulative mass shift of only ¡2 Da in the natalizumab Fd domain, were corrected as a result of this work.},

abstract = {The primary structural information of proteins employed as biotherapeutics is essential if one wishes to understand their structure-function relationship, as well as in the rational design of new therapeutics and for quality control. Given both the large size (around 150 kDa) and the structural complexity of intact immunoglobulin G (IgG), which includes a variable number of disulfide bridges, its extensive fragmentation and subsequent sequence determination by means of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) are challenging. Here, we applied electron transfer dissociation (ETD), implemented on a hybrid Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS), to analyze a commercial recombinant IgG in a liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) top-down experiment. The lack of sensitivity typically observed during the top-down MS of large proteins was addressed by averaging time-domain transients recorded in different LC-MS/MS experiments before performing Fourier transform signal processing. The results demonstrate that an improved signal-to-noise ratio, along with the higher resolution and mass accuracy provided by Orbitrap FTMS (relative to previous applications of top-down ETD-based proteomics on IgG), is essential for comprehensive analysis. Specifically, ETD on Orbitrap FTMS produced about 33{\%} sequence coverage of an intact IgG, signifying an almost 2-fold increase in IgG sequence coverage relative to prior ETD-based analysis of intact monoclonal antibodies of a similar subclass. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology to other classes of large proteins and biomolecules. {\textcopyright}2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Antibodies (Abs) produced by immunoglobulin (IG) genes are the most diverse proteins expressed in humans. While part of this diversity is generated by recombination during B-cell development and mutations during affinity matu-ration, the germ-line IG loci are also diverse across human populations and ethnicities. Recently, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated genotype-phenotype correlations between specific IG germ-line variants and the quality of Ab responses during vaccination and disease. However, the functional consequences of IG genetic variation in Ab function and immunological outcomes remain underexplored. In this opinion article, we outline interconnec-tions between IG genomic diversity and Ab-expressed repertoires and structure. We further propose a strategy for integrating IG genotyping with functional Ab profiling data as a means to better predict and optimize humoral responses in genetically diverse human populations, with immediate implications for personalized medicine. The Molecular Basis for Antibody Diversity Antibodies (Abs) have long been appreciated as key constituents of the adaptive immune response. Their function is to enable selective recognition and mediate immune responses to novel foreign antigens. This is accomplished through the somatic generation of vast repertoires of hundreds of millions of unique Ab receptors that can be selected, matured, and ultimately participate in the formation of long-term memory during B-cell development and activation. As a consequence of this diversity, even after nearly a century of research, the complexity of the Ab response within and between individuals is only beginning to be delineated at the molecular and genetic levels. Hundreds of variable (V) and dozens of diversity (D) and joining (J) immunoglobulin (IG) germ-line gene segments across three primary loci in the human genome comprise the necessary building blocks of the expressed Ab heavy-and light-chain repertoires [1]. Whereas the heavy chain is encoded by genes at the IG heavy-chain locus (IGH), the light chain can be encoded by genes at either the IG kappa (IGK) or IG lambda (IGL) chain loci [1]. The na{\"{i}}ve Ab repertoire is formed by assembling variants of these building blocks using a specialized V(D)J recombination process that somatically joins various V, D, and J segments (or V and J at IGK and IGL[ 2 2 8 {\_} T D {\$} D},

Hybrids secreting antibodies to cell surface antigens were detected by assaying culture supernatants for antibody binding to human tonsil cells. Six different antibodies (called W6/1, /28, /32, /34, /45 and /46) were analyzed. These were either against antigens of wide tissue distribution (W6/32, /34, /45 and /46) or mainly on erythrocytes (W6/1 and W6/28). One of the anti-erythrocyte antibodies (W6/1) detected a polymorphic antigen, since blood group A1 and A2 erythrocytes were labeled while B and O were not. Antibodies W6/34, /45 and /46 were all against antigens which were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11 by segregation analysis of mouse-human hybrids. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that W6/45 antigen may be a protein of 16,000 dalton, apparent molecular weight, while W6/34 and /46 antigens could not be detected by this technique. Antibody W6/32 is against a determinant common to most, if not all, of the 43,000 dalton molecular weight chains of HLA-A, B and C antigens. This was established by somatic cell genetic techniques and by immunoprecipitation analysis. Tonsil leucocytes bound 370,000 W6/32 antibody molecules per cell at saturation. The hybrid myelomas W6/32 and W6/34 have been cloned, and both secrete an IgG2 antibody. W6/32 cells were grown in mice, and the serum of the tumor-bearing animals contained {\textgreater}10 mg/ml of monoclonal antibody. The experiments established the usefulness of the hybrid myeloma technique in preparing monospecific antibodies against human cell surface antigens. In particular, this study highlights the possibilities not only of obtaining reagents for somatic cell genetics, but also of obtaining mouse antibodies detecting human antigenic polymorphisms. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {The characterization of protein modifications is essential for the study of protein function using functional genomic and proteomic approaches. However, current techniques are not efficient in determining protein modifications. We report an approach for sequencing proteins and determining modifications with high speed, sensitivity and specificity. We discovered that a protein could be readily acid-hydrolyzed within 1 min by exposure to microwave irradiation to form, predominantly, two series of polypeptide ladders containing either the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the protein, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis of the hydrolysate produced a simple mass spectrum consisting of peaks exclusively from these polypeptide ladders, allowing direct reading of amino acid sequence and modifications of the protein. As examples, we applied this technique to determine protein phosphorylation sites as well as the sequences and several previously unknown modifications of 28 small proteins isolated from Escherichia coli K12 cells. This technique can potentially be automated for large-scale protein annotation.},

We investigate peptide de novo sequencing by precision mass spectrometry and explore some of the differences when compared to analysis of low-precision data.

Many glycans can be attached to proteins, but the most common are the N-linked gly- cans (oligosaccharides). These chains are added very soon after a protein enters the ER, but they undergo extensive remodeling (processing), especially in the Golgi. Processing changes the sensitivity of the N-glycan to enzymes that cleave entire sugar chains or in- dividual monosaccharides, which also changes the migration of the protein on SDS gels. These changes can be used to indicate when a protein has passed a particular subcellular location. This unit details some of the methods used to track a protein as it traffificks from the ER to the Golgi toward its final location.},

To interpret these paired spectra, we modified the UVnovo de novo sequencing software to automatically learn from and interpret fragmentation spectra, provided a representative set of training data. This machine learning procedure, using random forests, synthesizes information from one or multiple complementary spectra, such as the CID/UVPD pairs, into peptide fragmentation site predictions.

abstract = {Database search algorithms are the primary workhorses for the identification of tandem mass spectra. However, these methods are limited to the identification of spectra for which peptides are present in the database, preventing the identification of peptides from mutated or alternatively spliced sequences. A variety of methods has been developed to search a spectrum against a sequence allowing for variations. Some tools determine the sequence of the homologous protein in the related species but do not report the peptide in the target organism. Other tools consider variations, including modifications and mutations , in reconstructing the target sequence. However, these tools will not work if the template (homologous peptide) is missing in the database, and they do not attempt to reconstruct the entire protein target sequence. De novo identification of peptide sequences is another possibility, because it does not require a protein database. However, the lack of database reduces the accuracy. We present a novel proteogenomic approach, GenoMS, that draws on the strengths of database and de novo peptide identification methods. Protein sequence templates (i.e. proteins or genomic sequences that are similar to the target protein) are identified using the database search tool InsPecT. The templates are then used to recruit, align, and de novo sequence regions of the target protein that have diverged from the database or are missing. We used GenoMS to reconstruct the full sequence of an antibody by using spectra acquired from multiple digests using different proteases. Antibodies are a prime example of proteins that confound standard database identification techniques. The mature antibody genes result from large-scale genome rearrangements with flexible fusion boundaries and somatic hypermutation. Using GenoMS we automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of two immunoglobulin chains with accuracy greater than 98{\%} using a diverged protein database. Using the genome as the template, we achieve accuracy exceeding 97{\%}.},

abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become the experimental method of choice for high-throughput pro-teomics-based biological discovery. The two primary ways of analyzing MS/MS data are database search and de novo sequencing. In this paper, we present a new approach to peptide de novo sequencing, called MSNovo, which has the following advanced features. (1) It works on data generated from both LCQ and LTQ mass spectrometers and interprets singly, doubly, and triply charged ions. (2) It integrates a new probabilistic scoring function with a mass array-based dynamic programming algorithm. The simplicity of the scoring function, with only 6-10 parameters to be trained, avoids the problem of overfitting and allows MSNovo to be adopted for other machines and data sets easily. The mass array data structure explicitly encodes all possible peptides and allows the dynamic programming algorithm to find the best peptide. (3) Compared to existing programs, MSNovo predicts pep-tides as well as sequence tags with a higher accuracy, which is important for those applications that search protein databases using the de novo sequencing results. More specifically, we show that MSNovo outperforms other programs on various ESI ion trap data. We also show that for high-resolution data the performance of MSNovo improves significantly.

The exact factors crucial for the solubility of LCs are poorly understood, but it can be hypothesized that their amino acid sequence plays an important role. Determining the precise sequences of patient-derived LCs is therefore highly desirable. We establish here a novel de novo sequencing workflow for patient-derived LCs, based on the combination of bottom-up and top-down proteomics without database search. PEAKS is used for the de novo sequencing of peptides that are further assembled into full length LC sequences using ALPS. Top-down proteomics provides the molecular masses of proteoforms and allows the exact determination of the amino acid sequence including all posttranslational modifications. This pipeline is then used for the complete de novo sequencing of LCs extracted from the urine of 10 patients with multiple myeloma. We show that for the bottom-up part, digestions with trypsin and Nepenthes digestive fluid are sufficient to produce overlapping peptides able to generate the best sequence candidates. Top-down proteomics is absolutely required to achieve 100{\%} final sequence coverage and characterize clinical samples containing several LCs.

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes plays a key role in antibody mediated immunity. SHM in B cells provides the molecular basis for affinity maturation of antibodies. In this way SHM is key in optimizing antibody dependent immune responses. SHM is initiated by targeting the Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) to rearranged V(D)J and switch regions of Ig genes. The mutation rate of this programmed mutagenesis is {\~{}}10−3 base pairs per generation, a million-fold higher than the non-AID targeted genome of B cells. AID is a processive enzyme that binds single-stranded DNA and deaminates cytosines in DNA. Cytosine deamination generates highly mutagenic deoxy-uracil (U) in the DNA of both strands of the Ig loci. Mutagenic processing of the U by the DNA damage response generates the entire spectrum of base substitutions characterizing SHM at and around the initial U lesion. Starting from the U as a primary lesion, currently five mutagenic DNA damage response pathways have been identified in generating a well-defined SHM spectrum of C/G transitions, C/G transversions, and A/T mutations around this initial lesion. These pathways include (1) replication opposite template U generates transitions at C/G, (2) UNG2-dependent translesion synthesis (TLS) generates transversions at C/G, (3) a hybrid pathway comprising non-canonical mismatch repair (ncMMR) and UNG2-dependent TLS generates transversions at C/G, (4) ncMMR generates mutations at A/T, and (5) UNG2- and PCNA Ubiquitination (PCNA-Ub)-dependent mutations at A/T. Furthermore, specific strand-biases of SHM spectra arise as a consequence of a biased AID targeting, ncMMR, and anti-mutagenic repriming. Here, we review mammalian SHM with special focus on the mutagenic DNA damage response pathways involved in processing AID induced Us, the origin of characteristic strand biases, and relevance of the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Human antibodies consist of a heavy chain and one of two possible light chains, kappa ({\$}\kappa{\$}) or lambda ({\$}\lambda{\$}). Here we tested how these two possible light chains influence the overall antibody response to polysaccharide and protein antigens by measuring light chain usage in human monoclonal antibodies from antibody secreting cells obtained following vaccination with Pneumovax23. Remarkably, we found that individuals displayed restricted light chain usage to certain serotypes and that lambda antibodies have different specificities and modes of cross-reactivity than kappa antibodies. Thus, at both the monoclonal (7 kappa, no lambda) and serum levels (145 {\$}\mu{\$}g/mL kappa, 2.82 {\$}\mu{\$}g/mL lambda), antibodies to cell wall polysaccharide were nearly always kappa. The pneumococcal reference serum 007sp was analyzed for light chain usage to 12 pneumococcal serotypes for which it is well characterized. Similar to results at the monoclonal level, certain serotypes tended to favor one of the light chains (14 and 19A, lambda; 6A and 23F, kappa). We also explored differences in light chain usage at the serum level to a variety of antigens. We examined serum antibodies to diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197 and Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA-1. These responses tended to be kappa dominant (average kappa-to-lambda ratios of 4.52 and 9.72 respectively). Responses to the influenza vaccine were more balanced with kappa-to-lambda ratio averages having slight strain variations: seasonal H1N1, 1.1; H3N2, 0.96; B, 0.91. We conclude that antigens with limited epitopes tend to produce antibodies with restricted light chain usage and that in most individuals, antibodies with lambda light chains have specificities different and complementary to kappa-containing antibodies.},

abstract = {Background: Vaccines have greatly reduced the burden of infectious disease, ranking in their impact on global health second only after clean water. Most vaccines confer protection by the production of antibodies with binding affinity for the antigen, which is the main effector function of B cells. This results in short term changes in the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire when an immune response is launched, and long term changes when immunity is conferred. Analysis of antibodies in serum is usually used to evaluate vaccine response, however this is limited and therefore the investigation of the BCR repertoire provides far more detail for the analysis of vaccine response. Results: Here, we introduce a novel Bayesian model to describe the observed distribution of BCR sequences and the pattern of sharing across time and between individuals, with the goal to identify vaccine-specific BCRs. We use data from two studies to assess the model and estimate that we can identify vaccine-specific BCRs with 69{\%} sensitivity. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that statistical modelling can capture patterns associated with vaccine response and identify vaccine specific B cells in a range of different data sets. Additionally, the B cells we identify as vaccine specific show greater levels of sequence similarity than expected, suggesting that there are additional signals of vaccine response, not currently considered, which could improve the identification of vaccine specific B cells.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as the leading method for detection, quantification, and characterization of proteins. Nearly all proteomic workflows rely on proteomic databases to identify peptides and proteins, but these databases typically contain a generic set of proteins that lack variations unique to a given sample, precluding their detection. Fortunately, proteogenomics enables the detection of such proteomic variations and can be defined, broadly, as the use of nucleotide sequences to generate candidate protein sequences for mass spectrometry database searching. Proteogenomics is experiencing heightened significance due to two developments: (a) advances in DNA sequencing technologies that have made complete sequencing of human genomes and transcriptomes routine, and (b) the unveiling of the tremendous complexity of the human proteome as expressed at the levels of genes, cells, tissues, individuals, and populations. We review here the field of human proteogenomics, with an emphasis on its history, current implementations, the types of proteomic variations it reveals, and several important applications.},

abstract = {In this 12th annual installment of the Antibodies to Watch article series, we discuss key events in antibody therapeutics development that occurred in 2020 and forecast events that might occur in 2021. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed an array of challenges and opportunities to the healthcare system in 2020, and it will continue to do so in 2021. Remarkably, by late November 2020, two anti-SARS-CoV antibody products, bamlanivimab and the casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail, were authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the repurposed antibodies levilimab and itolizumab had been registered for emergency use as treatments for COVID-19 in Russia and India, respectively. Despite the pandemic, 10 antibody therapeutics had been granted the first approval in the US or EU in 2020, as of November, and 2 more (tanezumab and margetuximab) may be granted approvals in December 2020.* In addition, prolgolimab and olokizumab had been granted first approvals in Russia and cetuximab saratolacan sodium was first approved in Japan. The number of approvals in 2021 may set a record, as marketing applications for 16 investigational antibody therapeutics are already undergoing regulatory review by either the FDA or the European Medicines Agency. Of these 16 mAbs, 11 are possible treatments for non-cancer indications and 5 are potential treatments for cancer. Based on the information publicly available as of November 2020, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for non-cancer indications, including 6 for COVID-19, and marketing applications for at least 6 (leronlimab, tezepelumab, faricimab, ligelizumab, garetosmab, and fasinumab) are planned in 2021. In addition, 44 antibody therapeutics are in late-stage clinical studies for cancer indications. Of these 44, marketing application submissions for 13 may be submitted by the end of 2021. *Note added in proof on key events announced during December 1-21, 2020: margetuximab-cmkb and ansuvimab-zykl were approved by FDA on December 16 and 21, 2020, respectively; biologics license applications were submitted for ublituximab and amivantamab.},

abstract = {Separation of proteoforms for global intact protein analysis (i.e. top-down proteomics) has lagged well behind what is achievable for peptides in traditional bottom-up proteomic approach and is becoming a true bottle neck for top-down proteomics. Herein, we report use of long (≥1M) columns containing short alkyl (C1-C4) bonded phases to achieve high-resolution RPLC for separation of proteoforms. At a specific operation pressure limit (i.e., 96.5MPa or 14Kpsi used in this work), column length was found to be the most important factor for achieving maximal resolution separation of proteins when 1.5-5{\$}\mu{\$}m particles were used as packings and long columns provided peak capacities greater than 400 for proteoforms derived from a global cell lysate with molecular weights below 50kDa. Larger proteoforms (50-110kDa) were chromatographed on long RPLC columns and detected by MS; however, they cannot be identified yet by tandem mass spectrometry. Our experimental data further demonstrated that long alkyl (e.g., C8 and C18) bonded particles provided high-resolution RPLC for {\textless}10kDa proteoforms, not efficient for separation of global proteoforms. Reversed-phase particles with porous, nonporous, and superficially porous surfaces were systematically investigated for high-resolution RPLC. Pore size (200-400{\AA}) and the surface structure (porous and superficially porous) of particles was found to have minor influences on high-resolution RPLC of proteoforms. RPLC presented herein enabled confident identification of ∼900 proteoforms (1{\%} FDR) for a low-microgram quantity of proteomic samples using a single RPLC-MS/MS analysis. The level of RPLC performance attained in this work is close to that typically realized in bottom-up proteomics, and broadly useful when applying e.g., the single-stage MS accurate mass tag approach, but less effective when combined with current tandem MS. Our initial data indicate that MS detection and fragmentation inefficiencies provided by current high-resolution mass spectrometers are key challenges for characterization of larger proteoforms.},

@article{Lee2006,
abstract = {We have used a bioinformatics approach to evaluate the completeness and functionality of the reported human immunoglobulin heavy-chain IGHD gene repertoire. Using the hidden Markov-model-based iHMMune-align program, 1,080 relatively unmutated heavy-chain sequences were aligned against the reported repertoire. These alignments were compared with alignments to 1,639 more highly mutated sequences. Comparisons of the frequencies of gene utilization in the two databases, and analysis of features of aligned IGHD gene segments, including their length, the frequency with which they appear to mutate, and the frequency with which specific mutations were seen, were used to determine the reliability of alignments to the less commonly seen IGHD genes. Analysis demonstrates that IGHD4-23 and IGHD5-24, which have been reported to be open reading frames of uncertain functionality, are represented in the expressed gene repertoire; however, the functionality of IGHD6-25 must be questioned. Sequence similarities make the unequivocal identification of members of the IGHD1 gene family problematic, although all genes except IGHD1-14*01 appear to be functional. On the other hand, reported allelic variants of IGHD2-2 and of the IGHD3 gene family appear to be nonfunctional, very rare, or nonexistent. Analysis also suggests that the reported repertoire is relatively complete, although one new putative polymorphism (IGHD3-10*p03) was identified. This study therefore confirms a surprising lack of diversity in the available IGHD gene repertoire, and restriction of the germ-line sequence databases to the functional set described here will substantially improve the accuracy of IGHD gene alignments and therefore the accuracy of analysis of the V-D-J junction. {\textcopyright}Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovoþ, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides). Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines. UniNovo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd.edu/Software/UniNovo.html along with the manual.},

abstract = {Recently we have discovered an IgG degrading enzyme of the endemic pig pathogen S. suis designated IgdE that is highly specific for porcine IgG. This protease is the founding member of a novel cysteine protease family assigned C113 in the MEROPS peptidase database. Bioinformatical analyses revealed putative members of the IgdE protease family in eight other Streptococcus species. The genes of the putative IgdE family proteases of S. agalactiae, S. porcinus, S. pseudoporcinus and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus were cloned for production of recombinant protein into expression vectors. Recombinant proteins of all four IgdE family proteases were proteolytically active against IgG of the respective Streptococcus species hosts, but not against IgG from other tested species or other classes of immunoglobulins, thereby linking the substrate specificity to the known host tropism. The novel IgdE family proteases of S. agalactiae, S. pseudoporcinus and S. equi showed IgG subtype specificity, i.e. IgdE from S. agalactiae and S. pseudoporcinus cleaved human IgG1, while IgdE from S. equi was subtype specific for equine IgG7. Porcine IgG subtype specificities of the IgdE family proteases of S. porcinus and S. pseudoporcinus remain to be determined. Cleavage of porcine IgG by IgdE of S. pseudoporcinus is suggested to be an evolutionary remaining activity reflecting ancestry of the human pathogen to the porcine pathogen S. porcinus. The IgG subtype specificity of bacterial proteases indicates the special importance of these IgG subtypes in counteracting infection or colonization and opportunistic streptococci neutralize such antibodies through expression of IgdE family proteases as putative immune evasion factors. We suggest that IgdE family proteases might be valid vaccine targets against streptococci of both human and veterinary medical concerns and could also be of therapeutic as well as biotechnological use.},

abstract = {With the increasing accessibility of Fourier transform (FT) mass spectrometers, top-down/middle-down MS/MS characterization of protein sequences is rapidly gaining popularity. Compared to conventional bottom-up sequencing, the top-down/middle-down approach offers the advantages of fast sample preparation and unambiguous characterization of proteoforms in a mixture. If the modified or mutated peptide segment of interest is not found or recovered with the bottom-up approaches, top-down becomes attractive relative to spending time seeking the right enzyme or chromatographic approach. Here, we discuss the potential and limitations of protein sequence analysis by top-down/middle-down MS/MS alone. Even if 100{\%} protein sequence coverage is achieved by MS/MS, fragment mass error tolerance as low as 1 ppm or 0.5 ppm is needed to differentiate glutamine from lysine at positions not exceeding 330 amino acids (AAs) or 660 AAs from the N-/C-terminus for a protein with 660 AAs (72,760 Da) or 1320 AAs (145,520 Da). To characterize the “AA sequence gap” between two adjacent fragments, we show that the number of gap AA sequences with identical masses for di-, tri-, and tetra-AA gaps grows exponentially with increasing number of gap amino acids. If peptide fragment mass could be measured exactly (in practice, to 0.00001 Da), it would then be possible to define the overall atomic composition for the group of amino acids spanning a product ion gap 3–4 amino acids long. However, when we consider any 3–4 amino acid gap, we find that 50–75{\%} of the possible compositions describe at least two sets of amino acids. Moreover, a next-generation protein fragment deconvolution algorithm is critical to exploit the experimentally observed high mass accuracy generated from the 21 T FT-ICR MS/MS for high confidence and high throughput top-down/middle-down analysis of proteins with unknown sequences. Finally, we show that de novo top-down/middle-down MS/MS can determine the germline sequence category for a given monoclonal antibody (mAb) and further serve to identify its novel mutations.},

Prevailing bottom-up proteomics operates at the level of the peptide, leading to issues with protein inference, connectivity, and incomplete sequence/modification information. Top-down proteomics (TDP), alternatively, applies MS at the proteoform level to analyze intact proteins with diverse sources of intramolecular complexity preserved during analysis. Fortunately, advances in prefractionation workflows, MS instrumentation, and dissociation methods for whole-protein ions have helped TDP emerge as an accessible and potentially disruptive modality with increasingly translational value.

The need for complete characterization of the quality attributes of these molecules requires sophisticated techniques. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an essential analytical tool for the structural characterization of therapeutic antibodies, due to its superior resolution over other analytical techniques. It has been widely used in virtually all phases of antibody development. Structural features determined by MS include amino acid sequence, disulfide linkages, carbohydrate structure and profile, and many different post-translational, in-process, and in-storage modifications. In this review, we will discuss various MS-based techniques for the structural characterization of monoclonal antibodies. These techniques are categorized as mass determination of intact antibodies, and as middle-up, bottom-up, top-down, and middle-down structural characterizations. Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of structural resolution, sequence coverage, sample consumption, and effort required for analyses.

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing is generally more reliable on high-resolution instruments owing to their high resolution and mass accuracy. On a lower resolution instrument such as the more widely used quadrupole ion traps, de novo peptide sequencing is not so reliable or requires more MS 3 experiments. However, the peptide CID spectrum has been demonstrated to be quite reproducible on an ion trap instrument and can be predicted with good accuracy. A new de novo peptide sequencing technique, DACSIM, combining a divide-and-conquer algorithm for deriving sequence candidates and spectrum simulation for sequence refinement, is developed for spectra acquired on an ion trap instrument. When DACSIM was used to sequence peptides 500-1900 u in mass generated from proteolytic digests of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the success rate was 70{\%} with a false positive rate of only 6{\%}, when isoleucine and leucine residues were not distinguished. Peptide tandem mass spectra generated from low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) processes have been widely used in peptide sequence confirmation and protein identification by matching these tandem mass spectra to sequences in protein database. 1-6 When database search fails to provide the identification of a peptide, de novo sequencing is often performed to derive the sequence or partial sequence of the peptide. 7 Although some peptide modification schemes, either by chemical derivatization 8-13 or isotopic labeling, 14-20 have been used to simplify the spectrum interpretation, de novo sequencing from tandem spectra of unmodified peptides is often preferred. First, the extra step of wet chemistry is less desirable, especially when the procedure is sample limited. Second, de novo sequencing is often desired when a database search failed to provide identification of the precursor ion. In that case, tandem mass spectrum of the unmodified peptide is already available, and it is more desirable to derive the de novo sequence directly from this spectrum. A number of algorithms have been reported to derive the peptide sequence based on the tandem spectra of unmodified peptides. 21-34 Most of these algorithms generate high-score * Youngquist, R.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS) approaches for protein analysis, driven both by technological advancements and efforts such as those by the multinational Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (CTDP). Today, diverse sample preparation and ionization methods are employed to facilitate TDMS analysis of denatured and native proteins and their complexes. The goals of these studies vary, ranging from protein and proteoform identification, to determination of the binding site of a (non)covalently-bound ligand, and in some cases even with the aim to study the higher order structure of proteins and complexes. Currently, however, no widely accepted terminology exists to precisely and unambiguously distinguish between the different types of TDMS experiments that can be performed. Instead, ad hoc developed terminology is often used, which potentially complicates communication of top-down and allied methods and their results. In this communication, we consider the different types of top-down (or top-down-related) MS experiments that have been performed and reported, and define distinct categories based on the protocol used and type(s) of information that can be obtained. We also consider the different possible conventions for distinguishing between middle- and top-down MS, based on both sample preparation and precursor ion mass. We believe that the proposed framework presented here will prove helpful for researchers to communicate about TDMS and will be an important step toward harmonizing and standardizing this growing field.},

abstract = {The variable domain of an immunoglobulin (IG) sequence is encoded by multiple genes, including the variable (V) gene, the diversity (D) gene and the joining (J) gene. Analysis of IG sequences typically requires identification of each gene, as well as a comparison of sequence variations in the context of defined regions. General purpose tools, such as the BLAST program, have only limited use for such tasks, as the rearranged nature of an IG sequence and the variable length of each gene requires multiple rounds of BLAST searches for a single IG sequence. Additionally, manual assembly of different genes is difficult and error-prone. To address these issues and to facilitate other common tasks in analysing IG sequences, we have developed the sequence analysis tool IgBLAST (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/igblast/). With this tool, users can view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of IG V domain framework regions and complemen-tarity determining regions. IgBLAST has the capability to analyse nucleotide and protein sequences and can process sequences in batches. Furthermore, IgBLAST allows searches against the germline gene databases and other sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the best matching germline V gene.},

abstract = {Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches. In this paper we present ANTILOPE, a new fast and flexible approach based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and works with a variety of scoring schemes. ANTILOPE combines Lagrangian relaxation for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an adaptation of Yen's k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant improvement in running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs at the same speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a generic probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a dataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type. Evaluations on benchmark data show that ANTILOPE is competitive to the popular state-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and accuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of considered ion types. ANTILOPE will be freely available as part of the open source proteomics library OpenMS.},

Important parameters to consider when sequencing antibody repertoires include the methodology, the B-cell population and clinical characteristics of the individuals analysed, and the bioinformatic analysis. Although focused sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chains or complement determining regions can be utilized to monitor particular immune responses and B-cell malignancies, high-fidelity analysis of the full-length paired heavy and light chains expressed by individual B cells is critical for characterizing functional antibody repertoires. Bioinformatic identification of clonal antibody families and recombinant expression of representative members produces recombinant antibodies that can be used to identify the antigen targets of functional immune responses and to investigate the mechanisms of their protective or pathogenic functions. Integrated analysis of coexpressed functional genes provides the potential to further pinpoint the most important antibodies and clonal families generated during an immune response. Sequencing antibody repertoires is transforming our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer. We anticipate that antibody repertoire sequencing will provide next-generation biomarkers, diagnostic tools and therapeutic antibodies for a spectrum of diseases, including rheumatic diseases.},

Recent studies demonstrated that immune responses are characterized by the expression of congruent or similar complementarity determining regions (CDR) in different individuals and could be used as molecular targets in biomarker discovery. Main objective of this study was to characterize glaucoma-specific peptides from the variable region of sera-derived immunoglobulins using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based quantitative proteomics. IgG was purified from sera of 13 primary open-angle glau-coma patients (POAG) and 15 controls (CTRL) and subsequently digested into Fab and Fc by papain. Fab was further purified, tryptic digested and measured by LC-MS/MS. Discovery proteomics revealed in total 75 peptides of the variable IgG domain showing significant glaucoma-related level changes (P {\textless} 0.05; log2 fold change ! 0.5): 6 peptides were high abundant in POAG sera, whereas 69 peptides were low abundant in comparison to CTRL group. Via accurate inclusion mass screening strategy 28 IgG V domain peptides were further validated showing significantly decreased expression levels in POAG sera. Amongst others 5 CDR1, 2 CDR2 and 1 CDR3 sequences. In addition, we observed significant shifts in the variable heavy chain family distribution and disturbed j/k ratios in POAG patients in contrast to CTRL. These findings strongly indicate that glaucoma is accompanied by systemic effects on antibody production and B cell maturation possibly offering new prospects for future diagnostic or therapy purposes.},

abstract = {Purpose of review Biological agents have been a treatment option for many chronic immune-mediated diseases as well as oncological conditions. The issue of infusion reactions is of particular importance and at least in some cases related to the immunogenicity of these drugs with the production of antidrug antibodies. Infectious diseases are a well described side-effect of certain biological agents, even if, at least regarding the biological agents used for the treatment of allergic diseases and immune-mediated diseases, the risk has been reduced. Biological agents clearly impact the physiological functions of the immune system also those connected to immunosurveillance against cancers. This review discusses the safety profile to the main biological agents currently in use in allergic and chronic immune-mediated diseases. Recent findings By reducing chronic inflammation in immune-mediated diseases, biological agents decrease mortality, cardiovascular events without increasing significantly the risk of cancer. In addition, specific clinical procedure enables the identification of potentially reactive patients and the prevention of acute severe reactions. Overall, the ratio between therapeutic and side-effects is clearly in favor of the former. Summary The safety profile of biological agents is, just as much as their efficacy, one of the fundamental criteria justifying their clinical broad use.},

DeepNovo architecture combines recent advances in convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn features of tandem mass spectra, fragment ions, and sequence patterns of peptides. The networks are further integrated with local dynamic programming to solve the complex optimization task of de novo sequencing. We evaluated the method on a wide variety of species and found that DeepNovo considerably outperformed state of the art methods, achieving 7.7-22.9{\%} higher accuracy at the amino acid level and 38.1-64.0{\%} higher accuracy at the peptide level. We further used DeepNovo to automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of antibody light and heavy chains of mouse, achieving 97.5-100{\%} coverage and 97.2-99.5{\%} accuracy, without assisting databases. Moreover, DeepNovo is retrainable to adapt to any sources of data and provides a complete end-to-end training and prediction solution to the de novo sequencing problem. Not only does our study extend the deep learning revolution to a new field, but it also shows an innovative approach in solving optimization problems by using deep learning and dynamic programming.},

abstract = {The diversity of antibody variable regions makes cDNA sequencing challenging, and conventional monoclonal antibody cDNA amplification requires the use of degenerate primers. Here, we describe a simplified workflow for amplification of IgG antibody variable regions from hybridoma RNA by a specialized RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. We perform three separate reactions for each hybridoma: one each for kappa, lambda, and heavy chain transcripts. We prime reverse transcription with a primer specific to the respective constant region and use a template-switch oligonucleotide, which creates a custom sequence at the 5' end of the antibody cDNA. This template-switching circumvents the issue of low sequence homology and the need for degenerate primers. Instead, subsequent PCR amplification of the antibody cDNA molecules requires only two primers: one primer specific for the template-switch oligonucleotide sequence and a nested primer to the respective constant region. We successfully sequenced the variable regions of five mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies using this method, which enabled us to design chimeric mouse/human antibody expression plasmids for recombinant antibody production in mammalian cell culture expression systems. All five recombinant antibodies bind their respective antigens with high affinity, confirming that the amino acid sequences determined by our method are correct and demonstrating the high success rate of our method. Furthermore, we also designed RT-PCR primers and amplified the variable regions from RNA of cells transfected with chimeric mouse/human antibody expression plasmids, showing that our approach is also applicable to IgG antibodies of human origin. Our monoclonal antibody sequencing method is highly accurate, user-friendly, and very cost-effective.},

abstract = {De novo peptide sequencing has improved remarkably in the past decade as a result of better instruments and computational algorithms. However, de novo sequencing can correctly interpret only approximately 30{\%} of high- and medium-quality spectra generated by collision-induced dissociation (CID), which is much less than database search. This is mainly due to incomplete fragmentation and overlap of different ion series in CID spectra. In this study, we show that higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) is of great help to de novo sequencing because it produces high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra without the low-mass cutoff associated with CID in ion trap instruments. Besides, abundant internal and immonium ions in the HCD spectra can help differentiate similar peptide sequences. Taking advantage of these characteristics, we developed an algorithm called pNovo for efficient de novo sequencing of peptides from HCD spectra. pNovo gave correct identifications to 80{\%} or more of the HCD spectra identified by database search. The number of correct full-length peptides sequenced by pNovo is comparable with that obtained by database search. A distinct advantage of de novo sequencing is that deamidated peptides and peptides with amino acid mutations can be identified efficiently without extra cost in computation. In summary, implementation of the HCD characteristics makes pNovo an excellent tool for de novo peptide sequencing from HCD spectra.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several experimental therapeutics for Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been developed, the safety and efficacy of the most promising therapies need to be assessed in the context of a randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: We conducted a trial of four investigational therapies for EVD in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak began in August 2018. Patients of any age who had a positive result for Ebola virus RNA on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were enrolled. All patients received standard care and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to intravenous administration of the triple monoclonal antibody ZMapp (the control group), the antiviral agent remdesivir, the single monoclonal antibody MAb114, or the triple monoclonal antibody REGN-EB3. The REGN-EB3 group was added in a later version of the protocol, so data from these patients were compared with those of patients in the ZMapp group who were enrolled at or after the time the REGN-EB3 group was added (the ZMapp subgroup). The primary end point was death at 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients were enrolled from November 20, 2018, to August 9, 2019, at which time the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients be assigned only to the MAb114 and REGN-EB3 groups for the remainder of the trial; the recommendation was based on the results of an interim analysis that showed superiority of these groups to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 61 of 174 patients (35.1{\%}) in the MAb114 group, as compared with 84 of 169 (49.7{\%}) in the ZMapp group (P = 0.007), and in 52 of 155 (33.5{\%}) in the REGN-EB3 group, as compared with 79 of 154 (51.3{\%}) in the ZMapp subgroup (P = 0.002). A shorter duration of symptoms before admission and lower baseline values for viral load and for serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels each correlated with improved survival. Four serious adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the trial drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Both MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to ZMapp in reducing mortality from EVD. Scientifically and ethically sound clinical research can be conducted during disease outbreaks and can help inform the outbreak response.

abstract = {One challenge associated with the discovery and development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics is the determination of heavy chain and light chain pairing. Advances in MS instrumentation and MS/MS methods have greatly enhanced capabilities for the analysis of large intact proteins yielding much more detailed and accurate proteoform characterization. Consequently, direct interrogation of intact antibodies or F(ab′)2 and Fab fragments has the potential to significantly streamline therapeutic mAb discovery processes. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to efficiently cleave disulfide bonds linking heavy and light chains of mAbs using electron capture dissociation (ECD) and 157 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD). The combination of intact mAb, Fab, or F(ab′)2 mass, intact LC and Fd masses, and CDR3 sequence coverage enabled determination of heavy chain and light chain pairing from a single experiment and experimental condition. These results demonstrate the potential of top-down and middle-down proteomics to significantly streamline therapeutic antibody discovery.},

abstract = {We describe a new procedure that enables selective detection and sequencing of Ser-, Thr-, and Tyr-phosphopeptides at the low femtomole level in protein digests. Radiolabeling with 32p is not required, nor is prior chromatographic separation of the peptide mixture. One to two microliters of the unfractionated protein digest is infused at basic pH into an electrospray mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 20-40 nl/min using an ultra-low flow sprayer. A precursor-ion scan of m/z 79 (PO3) produces a mass spectrum containing only the molecular ions of the phosptopeptides that are present in the sample. In cases where the protein sequence is known, the peptide molecular weights obtained are often sufficient to identify the specific sequences that are phosphorylated. If the protein sequence is not known, tandem MS with collision-induced dissociation of phosphopeptide precursor- ions may be used to obtain the amino acid sequences including the site(s) of phosphorylation. We demonstrate that phosphopeptides may be selectively detected using as little as 3 fmol of a 10 fmol/{\$}\mu{\$}l solution and that sequence information for a phosphopeptide in the mixture may be obtained using as little as 3 femtomole of the same solution. In addition, we show that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation at specific sites may be estimated from the ratio of the ion signals for the respective forms of the peptides observed in the normal fullscan mass spectra of the digest. These procedures are illustrated here to identify and sequence phosphopeptides from {\$}\alpha{\$}- casein, a milk-derived protein possessing up to nine phosphorylation-sites. Numerous MS and tandem MS experiments were carried out on a single, 250 fmol/{\$}\mu{\$}l loading of the phosphoprotein digest. Phosphopeptides derived from an unexpected variant of the protein were also observed.},

abstract = {Dependent on concise, predefined protein sequence databases, traditional search algorithms perform poorly when analyzing mass spectra derived from wholly uncharacterized protein products. Conversely, de novo peptide sequencing algorithms can interpret mass spectra without relying on reference databases. However, such algorithms have been difficult to apply to complex protein mixtures, in part due to a lack of methods for automatically validating de novo sequencing results. Here, we present novel metrics for benchmarking de novo sequencing algorithm performance on large-scale proteomics data sets and present a method for accurately calibrating false discovery rates on de novo results. We also present a novel algorithm (LADS) that leverages experimentally disambiguated fragmentation spectra to boost sequencing accuracy and sensitivity. LADS improves sequencing accuracy on longer peptides relative to that of other algorithms and improves discriminability of correct and incorrect sequences. Using these advancements, we demonstrate accurate de novo identification of peptide sequences not identifiable using database search-based approaches.},

abstract = {Background: A recombinant humanized anti-IgE mAb, omalizumab, forms complexes with free IgE, blocking its interaction with mast cells and basophils; as a consequence, it might be effective in the treatment of asthma. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in the treatment of inhaled corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Methods: In this phase III, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 525 subjects with severe allergic asthma requiring daily inhaled corticosteroids were randomized to receive placebo or omalizumab subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks, depending on baseline IgE level and body weight. Inhaled corticosteroid doses were kept stable over the initial 16 weeks of treatment and tapered during a further 12-week treatment period. Results: Omalizumab treatment resulted in significantly fewer asthma exacerbations per subject and in lower percentages of subjects experiencing an exacerbation than placebo treatment during the stable steroid phase (0.28 vs 0.54 [P =.006] and 14.6{\%} vs 23.3{\%} [P =.009], respectively) and during the steroid reduction phase (0.39 vs 0.66 [P =.003] and 21.3{\%} vs 32.3{\%} [P =.004], respectively). Beclomethasone dipropionate reduction was significantly greater with omalizumab treatment than with placebo (median 75{\%} vs 50{\%} [P {\textless}.001]), and beclomethasone dipropionate discontinuation was more likely with omalizumab (39.6{\%} vs 19.1{\%} [P {\textless}.001]). Improvements in asthma symptoms and pulmonary function occurred along with a reduction in rescue {\$}\beta{\$}-agonist use. Omalizumab was well tolerated, with an adverse-events profile similar to that of placebo. Conclusion: The addition of omalizumab to standard asthma therapy reduces asthma exacerbations and decreases inhaled corticosteroid and rescue medication use.},

Here, we combined several mass-spectrometry-based approaches to reveal that the circulating IgG1 repertoire in human plasma is dominated by a limited number of clones in healthy donors and septic patients. We observe that each individual donor exhibits a unique serological IgG1 repertoire, which remains stable over time but can adapt rapidly to changes in physiology. We introduce an integrative protein- and peptide-centric approach to obtain and validate a full sequence of an individual plasma IgG1 clone de novo. This IgG1 clone emerged at the onset of a septic episode and exhibited a high mutation rate (13{\%}) compared with the closest matching germline DNA sequence, highlighting the importance of de novo sequencing at the protein level.

Despite a common chemical degradation pathway, the rates of Asn deamidation can vary dramatically among different sites, and prediction of the sensitive deamidation sites is still challenging. In this study, characterization of Asn deamidation for five IgG1 and five IgG4 mAbs under both normal and stressed conditions revealed dramatic differences in the Asn deamidation rates. A comprehensive analysis of the deamidation sites indicated that the deamidation rate differences could be explained by differences in the local structure conformation, structure flexibility and solvent accessibility. A decision tree was developed to predict the deamidation propensity for all Asn sites in IgG mAbs based on the analysis of these three structural parameters. This decision tree will allow potential Asn deamidation hot spots to be identified early in development.},

Furthermore, we apply a dual fragmentation scheme, using both stepped high-energy collision dissociation (stepped HCD) and electron-transfer high-energy collision dissociation (EThcD), on all peptide precursors. The method achieves full sequence coverage of the monoclonal antibody herceptin, with an accuracy of 99{\%} in the variable regions. We applied the method to sequence the widely used anti-FLAG-M2 mouse monoclonal antibody, which we successfully validated by remodeling a high-resolution crystal structure of the Fab and demonstrating binding to a FLAG-tagged target protein in Western blot analysis.

abstract = {Antibodies are vital proteins of the immune system that recognize potentially harmful molecules and initiate their removal. Mammals can efficiently create vast numbers of antibodies with different sequences capable of binding to any antigen with high affinity and specificity. Because they can be developed to bind to many disease agents, antibodies can be used as therapeutics. In an organism, after antigen exposure, antibodies specific to that antigen are enriched through clonal selection, expansion, and somatic hypermutation. The antibodies present in an organism therefore report on its immune status, describe its innate ability to deal with harmful substances, and reveal how it has previously responded. Next-generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used to query the antibody, or B-cell receptor (BCR), sequence repertoire, and the amount of BCR data in public repositories is growing. The Observed Antibody Space database, for example, currently contains over a billion sequences from 68 different studies. Repertoires are available that represent both the naive state (i.e. antigen-inexperienced) and that after immunization. This wealth of data has created opportunities to learn more about our immune system. In this review, we discuss the many ways in which BCR repertoire data have been or could be exploited. We highlight its utility for providing insights into how the naive immune repertoire is generated and how it responds to antigens. We also consider how structural information can be used to enhance these data and may lead to more accurate depictions of the sequence space and to applications in the discovery of new therapeutics.},

We describe a proteomics approach that identifies antigen-specific antibody sequences directly from circulating polyclonal antibodies in the serum of an immunized animal. The approach involves affinity purification of antibodies with high specific activity and then analyzing digested antibody fractions by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. High-confidence peptide spectral matches of antibody variable regions are obtained by searching a reference database created by next-generation DNA sequencing of the B-cell immunoglobulin repertoire of the immunized animal. Finally, heavy and light chain sequences are paired and expressed as recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Using this technology, we isolated monoclonal antibodies for five antigens from the sera of immunized rabbits and mice. The antigen-specific activities of the monoclonal antibodies recapitulate or surpass those of the original affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. This technology may aid the discovery and development of vaccines and antibody therapeutics, and help us gain a deeper understanding of the humoral response.},

abstract = {Most vaccines confer protection via the elicitation of serum antibodies, yet more than 100 y after the discovery of antibodies, the molecular composition of the human serum antibody repertoire to an antigen remains unknown. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem MS proteomic analyses of serum antibodies coupled with next-generation sequencing of the V gene repertoire in peripheral B cells, we have delineated the human serum IgG and B-cell receptor repertoires following tetanus toxoid (TT) booster vaccination. We show that the TT(+) serum IgG repertoire comprises ∼100 antibody clonotypes, with three clonotypes accounting for {\textgreater}40{\%} of the response. All 13 recombinant IgGs examined bound to vaccine antigen with Kd ∼ 10(-8)-10(-10) M. Five of 13 IgGs recognized the same linear epitope on TT, occluding the binding site used by the toxin for cell entry, suggesting a possible explanation for the mechanism of protection conferred by the vaccine. Importantly, only a small fraction ({\textless}5{\%}) of peripheral blood plasmablast clonotypes (CD3(-)CD14(-)CD19(+)CD27(++)CD38(++)CD20(-)TT(+)) at the peak of the response (day 7), and an even smaller fraction of memory B cells, were found to encode antibodies that could be detected in the serological memory response 9 mo postvaccination. This suggests that only a small fraction of responding peripheral B cells give rise to the bone marrow long-lived plasma cells responsible for the production of biologically relevant amounts of vaccine-specific antibodies (near or above the Kd). Collectively, our results reveal the nature and dynamics of the serological response to vaccination with direct implications for vaccine design and evaluation.},

abstract = {The enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) is a technique widely used to enumerate the number of immune cells secreting a specific protein, such as antibodies or cytokines. A limitation with the ELISPOT assay is that it can only be used to detect a single protein of interest. Recently, the ELISPOT technique has been modified to use fluorophores allowing multiple secreted proteins to be detected simultaneously. This technique has greatly enhanced the ability to identify cells secreting multiple proteins, but has not been used to its fullest potential. We wished to accurately quantify the expression of antigen-specific antibody from a single plasma cell and to determine whether plasma cells recovered from different locations had different secretion rates. To achieve this we analyzed fluorospot images quantitatively using Mira MX 7 UL Astronomy software, and coupled this data with a quantitative ELISA to determine secretion rates from individual cells. Using this technique we were able to determine that plasma cells recovered from the peripheral blood secreted the most antibody (1.667 ng/cell/12 h) while splenic antibody secreting cells the least (0.399 ng/cell/12 h). We were able to quantify a 150 fold difference in antibody secretion between cells, with most plasma cells divided into two groups, low secretors ({\textless}0.1 ng/cell) or high secretors ({\textgreater}2 ng/cell). We believe this technique will be particularly useful for examining the secretion ratio of two proteins secreted from an individual cell, allowing us to determine if secretion is fixed or variable. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

FcalphaRI has two immunoglobulin-like domains that are oriented at approximately right angles to each other. Fcalpha resembles the Fcs of immunoglobulins IgG and IgE, but has differently located interchain disulphide bonds and external rather than interdomain N-linked carbohydrates. Unlike 1:1 FcgammaRIII:IgG and Fc epsilon RI:IgE complexes, two FcalphaRI molecules bind each Fcalpha dimer, one at each Calpha2-Calpha3 junction. The FcalphaRI-binding site on IgA1 overlaps the reported polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)-binding site, which might explain why secretory IgA cannot initiate phagocytosis or bind to FcalphaRI-expressing cells in the absence of an integrin co-receptor.},

abstract = {The most significant recent development in techniques for the sequence analysis of proteins and peptides is the advent of automated procedures for degradation by the phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) method. The chapter describes the automated procedures in some detail from a practical point of view. In the Edman procedure, the reagent PITC couples with the terminal alpha amino group of a peptide or protein to form a phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) adduct. Under anhydrous acidic conditions, the N-terminal amino acid residue is selectively cleaved from the peptide chain as a heterocyclic derivative through the attack of the sulfur of the PTC adduct on the carbonyl component of the first peptide bond. The cleaved amino acid derivative is separated from the residual peptide by extraction with an organic solvent and then converted to a more stable isomer prior to identification by one of several possible procedures. The automated Edman procedure is particularly suitable for obtaining long degradations on polypeptides of 60–150 residues. With longer polypeptides, the increased background limits the length of the degradation. {\textcopyright}1973, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background Liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics for peptide identification. Liquid chromatography temporally separates the peptides in a sample. The peptides that elute one after another are analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide and its fragments. De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. Results We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Conclusions Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.},

abstract = {Antibodies are typical examples of biopharmaceuticals which are composed of numerous, almost infinite numbers of potential molecular entities called variants or isoforms, which constitute the microheterogeneity of these molecules. These variants are generated during biosynthesis by so-called posttranslational modification, during purification or upon storage. The variants differ in biological properties such as pharmacodynamic properties, for example, Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, complement activation, and pharmacokinetic properties, for example, serum half-life and safety. Recent progress in analytical technologies such as various modes of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has helped to elucidate the structure of a lot of these variants and their biological properties. In this review the most important modifications (glycosylation, terminal modifications, amino acid side chain modifications, glycation, disulfide bond variants and aggregation) are reviewed and an attempt is made to give an overview on the biological properties, for which the reports are often contradictory. Even though there is a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of antibody modification and their consequences, the clinical proof of the effects observed in vitro and in vivo is still not fully rendered. For some modifications such as core-fucosylation of the N-glycan and aggregation the effects are clear and should be monitored, but with others such as C-terminal lysine clipping the reports are contradictory. As a consequence it seems too early to tell if any modification can be safely ignored.},

Improvement of mass spectrometry instrumentation and sample processing methodologies have allowed intensive analysis of complex cell lysates, thus making it possible to identify thousands of proteins in addition to enabling comprehensive characterization of post translational modifications. The successful elucidation of the primary sequence of many peptides and proteins through tandem mass spectrometry has accelerated the development of other complementary methods that support targeted strategies and quantitative approaches and have catalyzed new applications of mass spectrometry in related fields, such as structural biology. This review will describe the development and applications of ion activation methods for peptides and proteins that have played such a critical role in the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, biotechnology, and structural biology. Moreover, unravelling the fundamental underpinnings of these activation methods have shed light on the factors that influence ion fragmentation upon energization, thus providing predictive insight and motivating new strategies that capitalize on manipulating ion dissociation behavior for specific applications. Given the critical role that tandem mass spectrometry has played in the field of proteomics and structural biology, this review will emphasize the ion activation methods that have been used to analyze peptides and proteins with an emphasis on new applications over the past three years. There are numerous excellent review and tutorial articles that have focused on mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies, proteomic applications, and specific activation methods in recent years, and thus readers are directed to these to provide additional perspectives.

As a consequence, its scope of application has gradually enlarged and diversified to meet specialized topical biomedical subjects. Although the tryptic bottom-up approach is widely regarded as the gold standard for rapid screening of complex samples, its application for precise and confident mapping of protein modifications is often hindered due to partial sequence coverage, poor redundancy in indicative peptides, and lack of method flexibility. We here show how the synergic and time-limited action of a properly diluted mix of multiple enzymes can be exploited in a versatile yet straightforward protocol to alleviate present-day drawbacks. Merging bottom-up and middle-down ideologies, our results highlight broad assemblies of overlapping peptides that enable refined and reliable characterizations of proteins, including variant identification, and their carried modifications, including post-translational modifications, truncations, and cleavages. Beyond this boost in performance, our methodology also offers efficient de novo sequencing capabilities, in view of which we here present a dedicated custom assembly algorithm.},

abstract = {Compared to traditional collision induced dissociation methods, electron capture dissociation (ECD) provides more comprehensive characterization of large peptides and proteins as well as preserves labile post-translational modifications. However, ECD experiments are generally restricted to the high magnetic fields of FTICR-MS that enable the reaction of large polycations and electrons. Here, we demonstrate the use of an electromagnetostatic ECD cell to perform ECD and hybrid ECD methods utilizing 193 nm photons (ECuvPD) or collisional activation (EChcD) in a benchtop quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The electromagnetostatic ECD cell was designed to replace the transfer octapole between the quadrupole and C-trap. This implementation enabled facile installation of the ECD cell, and ions could be independently subjected to ECD, UVPD, HCD, or any combination. Initial benchmarking and characterization of fragmentation propensities for ECD, ECuvPD, and EChcD were performed using ubiquitin (8.6 kDa). ECD yielded extensive sequence coverage for low charge states of ubiquitin as well as for the larger protein carbonic anhydrase II (29 kDa), indicating pseudo-activated ion conditions. Additionally, relatively high numbers of d- and w-ions enable differentiation of isobaric isoleucine and leucine residues and suggest a distribution of electron energies yield hot-ECD type fragmentation. We report the most comprehensive characterization to date for model proteins up to 29 kDa and a monoclonal antibody at the subunit level. ECD, ECuvPD, and EChcD yielded 93, 95, and 91{\%} sequence coverage, respectively, for carbonic anhydrase II (29 kDa), and targeted online analyses of monoclonal antibody subunits yielded 86{\%} overall antibody sequence coverage.},

Electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-based top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is the method of choice for in-depth characterization of post-translationally modified large peptides, small- and medium-sized proteins, and noncovalent protein complexes. Here, we describe the performance of ETD-based top-down mass spectrometry for structural analysis of intact 150 kDa monoclonal antibodies, immunoglobulins G (IgGs). Simultaneous mass analysis of intact IgGs as well as a complex mixture of ETD product ions at sufficiently high resolution and mass accuracy in a wide m/z range became possible because of recent advances in state-of-the-art time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. High-resolution ETD TOF MS performed on IgG1-kappa from murine myeloma cells and human anti-Rhesus D IgG1 resulted in extensive sequence coverage of both light and heavy chains of IgGs and revealed information on their variable domains. Results are superior and complementary to those previously generated by collision-induced dissociation. However, numerous disulfide bonds drastically reduce the efficiency of top-down ETD fragmentation within the protected sequence regions, leaving glycosylation uncharacterized. Further increases in the experiment sensitivity and improvement of ion activation before and after ETD reaction are needed to target S-S bond-protected sequence regions and post-translational modifications.},

The resulting DNA fragments were fractionated according to size in preparative agarose gel electrophoresis.

The pattern of hybridization with purified, 125I labeled, whole MOPC 321 kappa mRNA and with its 3' end half. The pattern of hybridization was completely different in the genomes of embryo cells and of the plasmacytoma. The pattern of embyro DNA showed two components, one of which (molecular weight = 6.0 million) hybridized with C gene sequences and the other (molecular weight = 3.9 million) with V gene sequences. The pattern of the tumor DNA showed a single component that hybridized with both V gene and C gene sequences and that is smaller (molecular weight = 2.4 million) than either of the components in embryo DNA. The results were interpreted to mean that the V(kappa) and C(kappa) genes, which are some distance away from each other in the embryo cells, are joined to form a continuous polynucleotide stretch during differentiation of lymphocytes. Such joining occurs in both of the homologous chromosomes. Relevance of these findings with respect to models for V-C gene joining, activation of a specific V(kappa) gene, and allelic exclusion in immunoglobulin gene loci is discussed.},

abstract = {The identification of the genes that make up rearranged immunoglobulin genes is critical to many studies. For example, the enumeration of mutations in immunoglobulin genes is important for the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and this requires the accurate identification of the germline genes from which a particular sequence is derived. The immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene repertoire is generally considered to be highly polymorphic. In this report, we describe a bioinformatic analysis of germline and rearranged immunoglobulin gene sequences which casts doubt on the existence of a substantial proportion of reported germline polymorphisms. We report a five-level classification system for IGHV genes, which indicates the likelihood that the genes have been reported accurately. The classification scheme also reflects the likelihood that germline genes could be incorrectly identified in mutated VDJ rearrangements, because of similarities to other alleles. Of the 226 IGHV alleles that have previously been reported, our analysis suggests that 104 of these alleles almost certainly include sequence errors, and should be removed from the available repertoire. The analysis also highlights the presence of common mismatches, with respect to the germline, in many rearranged heavy-chain sequences, suggesting the existence of twelve previously unreported alleles. Sequencing of IGHV genes from six individuals in this study confirmed the existence of three of these alleles, which we designate IGHV3-49*04, IGHV3-49*05 and IGHV4-39*07. We therefore present a revised repertoire of expressed IGHV genes, which should substantially improve the accuracy of immunoglobulin gene analysis. {\textcopyright}2008 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

Although disruptive technologies have yet escaped downstream processes, evolution of the so-called platform is already evident in antibody processes in late-stage development. Here we perform a wide survey of technologies that are competing to be part of that platform, and provide our [inherently dangerous] assessment of those that have the most promise. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Despite the great success of mass spectrometry (MS) for de novo protein sequencing, Leu and Ile have been generally considered to be indistinguishable by MS because their molecular masses are exactly the same. Positioning of incorrect Leu/Ile residues in variable domains, especially in CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of an antibody, may result in substantial loss of antigen binding affinity and specificity of the antibody. Here, we describe an integrated LC–MS based strategy, encompassing a combination of HCD (high-energy collisional dissociation) multistage mass spectrometric analysis (HCD-MSn) and ETD (electron transfer dissociation)-HCD MS3 analysis using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer, to reliably identify Leu and Ile residues in proteins and peptides. The merits and limitations of this Leu/Ile discrimination approach are evaluated. Using the new approach, along with proposed decision-making guidelines we unambiguously identified every Leu/Ile residue in peptides containing up to five...},
