abstract = {Amino-terminal (N-terminal) sequence analysis is used to identify the order of amino acids of proteins or peptides, starting at their N-terminal end. This unit describes the sequence analysis of protein or peptide samples in solution or bound to PVDF membranes using a Perkin-Elmer Procise Sequencer. Sequence analysis of protein or peptide samples in solution or bound to PVDF membranes using a Hewlett-Packard Model G1005A sequencer is also described. Methods are provided for optimizing separation of PTH amino acid derivatives on Perkin-Elmer instruments and for increasing the proportion of sample injected onto the PTH analyzer on older Perkin-Elmer instruments by installing a modified sample loop. The amount of data obtained from a single sequencer run is substantial, and careful interpretation of this data by an experienced scientist familiar with the current operation performance of the instrument used for this analysis is critically important. A discussion of data interpretation is therefore provided. Finally, discussion of optimization of sequencer performance as well as possible solutions to frequently encountered problems is included.},

abstract = {Edman degradation remains the primary method for determining the sequence of proteins. In this study, accelerator mass spectrom-etry was used to determine the N-terminal sequence of glutathione S-transferase at the attomole level with zeptomole precision using a tracer of 14 C. The transgenic transferase was labeled by growing transformed Escherichia coli on [ 14 C]glucose and purified by mi-croaffinity chromatography. An internal standard of peptides on a solid phase synthesized to release approximately equal amounts of all known amino acids with each cycle were found to increase yield of gas phase sequencing reactions and subsequent semimicrobore HPLC as did a lactoglobulin carrier. This method is applicable to the sequencing of proteins from cell culture and illustrates a path to more general methods for determining N-terminal sequences with high sensitivity.},
