!Summary
\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{A}{antibodies} are essential to adaptive immunity and represent one of the most polymorphic proteins found in the human body. This polymorphism provides the incredible flexibility seen in adaptive immunity and makes antibodies a true "personalized proteome", unique to each individual and adapted to their needs. However, this diversity also makes studying antibodies difficult. The chapters in this thesis detail efforts to develop generalizable data analysis strategies for studying secreted antibody repertoires using mass spectrometry.
In Chapter 2, we highlight the importance of having generalized tools to effectively analyze large and complex proteomic datasets. While crosslinking MS has emerged as an attractive method to probe protein interactions, the complexity of dealing with protein interactions rather than individual proteins has resulted in the production of large amounts of data, making processing difficult, especially for whole proteome experiments. To address this issue, we have developed a tool that is interactive and facilitates analysis and visualization of these large datasets. The tool directly handles the output of XlinkX for Proteome Discoverer but can also be used with output from other platforms through a user-controllable text-file importer. It comes equipped with a spectrum viewer and supports preprocessing of replicate datasets, enabling easy handling of large amounts of data. We have also integrated data from protein databases eggnog and uniprot, which enables integrated gene ontology enrichment analysis, grouping based on function, and mapping of known post-translational modification sites, domains, and secondary structures. Another feature is length-based validation of detected crosslinks by mapping the crosslinked peptides onto known structures of proteins or protein complexes. In situations where no structure is available, homologous structures can be used. In such cases, crosslinked peptides are aligned to the homologous sequence to obtain a confident placement of the linked residues before the distance between these residues is calculated using the 3D structure. Crosslinks between two proteins with known structures where no structure of the complex is available can also be directly submitted to DisVis for visualization and quantification of the information content of distance restraints.
In Chapter 3, we show how recent advancements in intact protein mass spectrometry allow for the detection of single IgG1 molecules in human serum. This enabled the construction of personalized secretory IgG1 repertoires. Despite there being an enormous number of theoretically possible clones, the observed secreted antibody repertoires were relatively simple, with only several hundred clones dominating at any given time point. Moreover, while the majority of the clones in these profiles were stable over time, we observed large changes in the repertoires following a sepsis episode. We also demonstrated that a combination of peptide- and protein-centric mass spectrometry could be employed to sequence individual clones directly from the serum. The peptide-centric approach provided extensive coverage, while the protein-centric (fragmentation) approach provided sequence information that is inherently grouped per clone. The synergy between these techniques was used to sequence a single highly abundant clone from the sample of one of our donors.
Chapter 4 showcases the potential of profiling data to compare and characterize individual donors within a group. We constructed SIgA1 profiles for a cohort of six lactating women who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The resulting profiles complement findings from earlier ELISA-based titer level analysis of these samples, where a biphasic rise in spike-specific IgA was found. Our observations indicate the emergence of a heterogeneous polyclonal population of between 100 and 200 novel clones in all donors after vaccination. This vaccine-induced population is dominated by a persistent population of clones that appear shortly after the initial vaccination and persist until at least five days after the second. However, we also detect a population of clones that emerge more than three days after the second vaccination was administered, in every donor. In-depth analysis of a strong responder, selected by ELISA and confirmed by our data, reveals that the second rise in spike-specific IgA coincides with an abundant second dose-induced population, highlighting the divergent clonal makeup of what initially seemed like a symmetrical biphasic response. Additionally, we observed several highly abundant clones appear and subsequently disappear from the secreted repertoire over the course of ~40 days, showing that highly abundant clones do not necessarily persist over time.
In Chapter 5, we built upon the proof of concept for endogenous antibody sequencing presented in Chapter 2 to create a more standardized and broadly applicable workflow for sequencing antibody chains in mixtures using a combination of peptide- and protein-centric mass spectrometry. The proposed approach sequences a target chain in a modular, three-stage process based on germline domains. It starts with sequencing the framework regions, followed by complementarity determining regions with flanking framework regions, and ultimately full chain sequences. Through integration of middle-down fragmentation, we could resolve ambiguity in de novo sequence predictions for the hypervariable complementarity determining regions. To achieve this, we filtered candidate sequences by comparing their theoretical mass to the gap between adjacent framework regions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by accurately sequencing a single targeted chain in a pure monoclonal antibody sample, an equimolar mixture of three monoclonal antibodies, and a polyclonal serum sample. This approach provides a broadly applicable workflow that could be used in future studies to sequence complex samples with high accuracy, as well as a step towards full automation of the process.
!Perspective and Outlook
Recent work by Wolf et al. \cite{Wolf2022Antibody Levels Poorly Reflect on the Frequency of Memory B Cells Generated following SARS-CoV-2, Seasonal Influenza, or EBV Infection} demonstrated that antibody titers of an individual were a poor marker of the frequency of memory B cells. If the assessment of humoral immunity by measurement of polyclonal antibody titers does not reflect an individual’s ability to mount an antibody response, then we need to find additional ways to determine an individual’s level of protection, and I believe the research presented in this thesis describes a promising strategy to this end through improved immune characterization.
By monitoring proteomic antibody dynamics at an unprecedented resolution, we can gain new insights into humoral immune responses by uncovering when, how and why specific antibodies come up in response to physiological events. Coupled with targeted proteomic sequencing of endogenous antibodies, this puts exciting milestones on the horizon, such as the discovery of immune signatures for use in disease risk assessment, diagnostic classification and measuring treatment effectiveness, or the integration of proteomic antibody repertoire profiling and targeted proteomic antibody sequencing into antibody drug development pipelines.
!!The importance of standardized tools
The advancements made over the last decade in MS-based antibody sequencing provide an optimistic outlook for the future. We expect that a therapeutic antibody discovered by MS could be right around the corner. Looking back at the timeline of key developments in the field of antibody sequencing, we can notice several clear trends (Figure 7). Since the 1960s, rudimentary sample preparation for antibodies was available, but practical methods of obtaining sequence information appeared only in 1993, when Sanger sequencing was first applied to B cells. The first therapeutic antibody was registered in 1986, and this advent launched large-scale development of mAbs, with a hundred mAbs registered by 2008.\cite{Raybould2020Thera-SAbDab: the Therapeutic Structural Antibody Database.} At that point, next-generation sequencing led to high-throughput sequencing workflows and further facilitated the development of therapeutic antibodies. Over the last 20 years, the rapid expansion of genome-based sequencing techniques kick-started antibody discovery by allowing large-scale BCR sequencing, and the number of deposited antibody sequences and registered antibody therapeutics has been growing exponentially ever since, with the 100th therapeutic mAb being approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2021.\cite{Mullard2021FDA approves 100th monoclonal antibody product} Observing this trend, the popularization of MS-based proteomics has now spurred the development of platforms for de novo sequencing of antibodies heavily supported by MS, and I envision that the ongoing advancement of MS based proteomic antibody profiling and de novo sequencing will complement available strategies by protein-level. More specifically, monitoring of proteomic antibody repertoires could be used to select a limited number of reactive antibodies from a patient with an effective immune response, which could then be sequenced and recombinantly produced. Such a direct approach to antibody discovery would be much more straightforward than screening of B-cells at the DNA/RNA level.
Similar patterns can be observed for the discovery of genomic and proteomic biomarkers: as standardized, high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques became widely accessible, the number of genomic and proteomic biomarkers for disease risk assessment, early diagnosis, diagnostic classification and measuring treatment effectiveness skyrocketed. I believe the current advances in immune response characterization could represent a similar opportunity, as large-scale, in-depth characterization of proteomic antibody repertoires may lead to the discovery of defined immune signatures that could be used as immunological biomarkers in very similar ways. 
!!Challenges
!!!Larger sample size needed
However, several challenges must be overcome before we can realize these goals. At the present time, there is simply not enough proteomic antibody repertoire data to draw generalizable conclusions about antibody repertoire dynamics. While we clearly observe drastic changes in the clonal abundance profiles in response to disease and vaccination, the significance of these clones in relation to the antigen is not yet apparent. The fact that these repertoires are unique to each donor means we cannot simply compare the clonal repertoires of donors to screen for antibodies of interest, which, combined with the complex and heterogenous nature of these responses, makes finding patterns extremely challenging. Larger cohorts will need to be studied, and the obtained longitudinal antibody repertoires should be correlated to established techniques. Existing techniques like ELISA, BCR sequencing and neutralization assays will be well complemented by the detailed characterization of the proteomic antibody repertoire. B cell receptor sequencing data could be used to determine the genetic and cellular origin of circulating clones, shedding light on whether novel clones are the result of somatic hypermutation or if they are the result of a completely new recombination of variable, diversity and joining (VDJ) gene recombination. Neutralization and binding assays could be used to determine exactly when an effective response emerges which can then be related to changes in the clonal profile. Such information on (individual) Fabs and the B-cells which produce them could be useful in studying the personalized nature of immune responses. As we increasingly correlate other assays to LC-MS Fab profiling data, we may also be able to distill a set of features common to effective neutralizing antibodies.
!!!Dealing with low-abundant clones
A deep characterization of the proteomic antibody repertoire would also be highly desirable, as the sought after features and clones may not be among the most abundant fraction of the repertoire. While the observed number of clones is limited (50-500), and among these observed clones there is an even more limited number of abundant clones dominating the repertoire, the dynamic range of secreted antibodies has already been shown to be very wide and there may still be low abundant clones fall below the current limit of detection. This is compounded by the fact that obtaining accurate uncharged, monoisotopic masses for intact proteins (i.e. deconvolution) is an incredibly challenging task, particularly for low abundant species in complex samples. As we identify clones by mass and retention time, an inconsistent mass determination would impede our ability to perform longitudinal tracking of the clone in question. Similarly, a robust chromatography setup is required to prevent shifts in retention time due to an unstable system. 
!!!Clonal lineage analysis and profiling ms
Outside of experimental variation or artefacts of spectral processing, antibodies are highly polymorphic species and as such are subject to constant mutations which almost certainly lead to significant mass- and retention time shifts. Mutated clones would therefore show up as novel species in the antibody repertoire. While the ability to distinguish between these clones makes our analysis powerful, it also means that we are so far unable to identify clones with a shared clonal ancestor. While such clonal lineage analysis should in theory be greatly facilitated by referring detected masses to BCR-sequencing data, we have only been able to identify a very small overlap between these two data streams. This apparent disjoint between the genomic or transcriptomic BCR sequences and proteomic data seems to indicate that we are still missing a piece of the puzzle. A possible explanation lies in the origin of the sequenced B cells, as the most commonly used B cells for BCR sequencing are peripheral B cells, which only represent about 2% of the total B cell population \cite{Guthals2017De Novo MS/MS Sequencing of Native Human Antibodies}. 
!!!The need for sequencing/disjoint BCR
While limited sequence information, in the form of sequence tags for example \cite{Tabb2008DirecTag: Accurate sequence tags from peptide MS/MS through statistical scoring}, could provide some means of excluding the possibility of a shared clonal lineage, complete certainty requires full knowledge of the protein sequence of two clones. Unfortunately, in the current stage of implementation, de novo sequencing of antibodies is still a highly challenging task which requires manual curation by experts to derive the correct sequence. This manual curation is not only time-consuming, but also makes the process subject to interpretation errors when compared to more established sequencing techniques such as next generation DNA/RNA sequencing. As such, the need for automation is high, to improve not only the throughput but also the reproducibility and robustness.
!!!Sequencing-specific challenges
Several challenges need to be surmounted to achieve automated sequencing of abundant clones in polyclonal mixtures. Similar to deconvolution of intact mass spectra (MS1), accurate and consistent deconvolution of fragmentation spectra (MS2) is immensely challenging, doubly so even, as signal intensity is split across multiple fragments. Low abundant fragments are hard to consistently acquire, and fragment coverage (i.e. the fraction of amide bonds that have one or more matching fragment mass in the spectrum) is typically limited. Peptide-centric analysis are hindered by the presence of other clones with homologous sequences, short peptide length and low depth of coverage, which make read assembly exceptionally challenging. Nevertheless, leveraging the synergy between the peptide- and protein-centric MS, as well as the available germline sequences has made sequencing of abundant clones in serum possible, and the generalizable workflow I have presented in this thesis represents a steppingstone towards full automation. 
!!!Factors impacting sequencing strategies
As antibody samples can be incredibly diverse, the big challenge will be to keep these workflows broadly applicable. The optimal strategy for a sequencing experiment will depend on many factors: How many other clones are in the sample? Are these other clones relatively abundant? Are specific proteases available to facilitate middle down analysis? How much sample is available? Are there coeluting clones? Is there the possibility for affinity purification or fractionation prior to sequencing? How divergent is the clone from the germline sequence? How good is bottom-up coverage? How good is top-down coverage? Many of these questions cannot be answered before starting the experiment or require additional analyses and therefore time, resources, and sample. While this may seem like a negative outlook, it is good to remember that just a few years ago detection and deconvolution of individual antibody clones in complex samples such as serum would have seemed practically impossible and sequencing them even more so. The incredible advances in the field of biomolecular mass spectrometry over the past decades are an indication that there really is no telling how far we can still improve through incremental improvements, not only to spectral processing and acquisition but also to downstream processing of the data.
!!!Protein centric improvements
In my opinion, the current stage of implementation of de novo sequencing of endogenous antibodies has only scratched the surface of the possibilities, and there is a litany of opportunities to improve data analysis, instrumentation and protocol adaptations that are readily available. Nano-flow LC-MS can reduce sample requirements, making it possible to include much more middle down fragmentation data. Parallel acquisition strategies as seen in several 2D-MS techniques could boost signal intensity, and super resolution methods could provide greater resolving power. Improving the selection of peaks for fragmentation either by implementing some form of real-time processing or providing an inclusion list of target m/zs based on a separate full MS spectrum of the same sample. While the current generalized implementation is focused around ETD of reduced antibody chains, we have found ETD of intact fabs to yield highly complementary fragments which could be beneficial. Similarly, alternative fragmentation methods may prove to each have their own strengths and weaknesses which can complement each other. We have also landed on the Xtract and respect deconvolution algorithms as our deconvolution method of choice, but there are alternatives out there. One particular drawback of our current methodology is that it is restricted to deconvolution of scans from a single raw file and does not allow for manual selection of MS2 scans to average for deconvolution, instead only supporting a retention time window. MSdeisotope was an alternative that we have yet to explore. 
!!!Peptide centric improvements
Our peptide centric efforts have been centered around using the de novo read assembly tool stitch, combined with PEAKS de novo sequencing suite, both of which are under continued development as well as many other novel de novo peptide sequencing algorithms. Our peptide-centric sequencing strategies have been greatly optimized during my PhD, but improvements are still possible. One suggestion has been to provide exclusion lists of known C-region peptides. We have also started using SP3 beads. 
!!Conclusion
All of this serves to say that I am very optimistic about the future of endogenous antibody sequencing and the role that mass spectrometry will play in it. With respect to sequencing, much of the effort in converging on a single sequence matching the protein-centric evidence serves to identify mutations in the framework regions. While there is merit in the complete and accurate determination of an antibody sequence, if the end goal is to acquire a functionally similar antibody, CDR sequencing should be prioritized and chain candidates for which the CDRs can be confirmed should be evaluated for functional equality to the target. To this end, bottom-up sequencing data is an extremely valuable tool, as is modular sequencing as described in this thesis.
However, the holy grail in the field of proteomic antibody repertoire analysis is and should remain full determination of the antibody sequence. The significance of FR mutations cannot be determined without knowledge of these mutations, and the presence of sequenced BCRs in bodily fluids cannot be confirmed without a full sequence. Thus, if we are to comprehensively map the secreted antibody repertoire, as well as its clonal lineages and dynamics, then we need accurate, high-throughput, proteomic sequence analysis, and I foresee that mass spectrometry will be the method of choice to achieve these goals.
